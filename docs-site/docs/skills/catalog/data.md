# Data & Analytics Skills

Skills for data science, data engineering, and analytics workflows.

---

### data-science

> Data analysis workflow from import through modeling and communication. Covers tidy data, EDA, statistical reasoning, and visualization. Use when analyzing datasets, building statistical models, exploring data, or communicating findings.

**Triggers:** Analyzing datasets, exploring data, building statistical models, creating visualizations, cleaning messy data, communicating findings
**Tools:** `Bash(python:*) Bash(jupyter:*) Read Write`
**References:** `tidy-data-principles.md`, `statistical-methods.md`, `visualization-guidelines.md`

Key capabilities:

- Import and clean data: inspect shape/dtypes/nulls, handle missing data explicitly, parse dates, validate assumptions
- Reshape data to tidy form (one variable per column, one observation per row) using melt/pivot
- Conduct exploratory data analysis: univariate distributions, bivariate relationships, outlier detection, groupby aggregations
- Apply statistical reasoning: state the question first, check assumptions, report effect sizes alongside p-values, use confidence intervals
- Perform feature selection: remove zero-variance features, handle multicollinearity, use domain knowledge then data-driven methods
- Follow model selection workflow: start simple (baseline), add complexity only when justified, use cross-validation, document decisions
- Visualize with best practices: titles, axis labels, colorblind-friendly palettes, annotations, publication-quality export
- Communicate results: lead with findings, plain language, show uncertainty, include actionable "so what"

<details><summary>Example usage</summary>

"I have a CSV of customer transactions. Help me understand churn patterns." -- Loads the CSV, prints shape/dtypes/nulls, creates tidy time-series per customer, runs EDA with churn-rate distributions and cohort analysis, tests whether usage frequency differs between churned/retained groups (t-test with effect size), and produces annotated visualizations summarizing the key drivers.

### data-pipeline

> Data pipeline patterns including ETL/ELT, batch vs streaming, idempotency, and orchestration. Use when designing data pipelines, reviewing data workflows, or troubleshooting data processing.

**Triggers:** Designing data pipelines, choosing batch vs. streaming, implementing data ingestion or transformation, setting up orchestration, debugging pipeline failures
**Tools:** `Bash Read Write`
**References:** None

Key capabilities:

- Choose between ETL and ELT based on target system capabilities and governance requirements
- Decide batch vs. streaming: start with batch unless explicit real-time requirement, micro-batch as middle ground
- Ensure idempotency: upserts, partition overwrite on rerun, deduplication by natural key hash
- Implement data quality checks at each stage: row counts, null checks, value range validation, fail fast on violations
- Manage schemas with registries, backward compatibility, versioning, and field documentation
- Design backfill strategies with date-range parameters, partition overwrite, and progress tracking
- Set up orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) with explicit DAG dependencies, retries with exponential backoff, and SLA tagging
- Monitor pipelines with alerts on failure/SLA breach, metadata logging, and dead letter queues for failed records

<details><summary>Example usage</summary>

"Design a pipeline to load daily sales data from an API into our warehouse" -- Designs an ELT pipeline: extract (API call with pagination, save raw JSON to cloud storage), load (bulk insert into staging), transform (SQL in warehouse to clean, deduplicate, join). Adds date-range parameters for backfills, idempotent loads via partition overwrite, row-count checks, and an Airflow DAG with retries.

### data-visualization

> Data visualization best practices including chart selection, color accessibility, and dashboard design. Use when creating charts, designing dashboards, or reviewing data presentations.

**Triggers:** Creating charts, designing dashboards, choosing visualization types, improving chart readability, reviewing data presentations
**Tools:** `Bash(python:*) Read Write`
**References:** `chart-selection.md`

Key capabilities:

- Select chart types by data relationship: bar for comparison, line for trend, histogram for distribution, scatter for relationship
- Apply color and accessibility: colorblind-friendly palettes (viridis, cividis), sequential/diverging/categorical schemes, 7-color maximum
- Annotate insights: max/min values, threshold lines, trend-change events, direct labels instead of legends
- Design dashboard layouts: most important metric top-left, consistent grid, grouped by domain, filters at top, 6-8 visualizations max
- Tell stories with data: lead with conclusion, context-finding-implication structure, progressive disclosure, highlight the relevant
- Choose static vs. interactive: matplotlib/seaborn for reports, plotly/Altair/D3 for dashboards with tooltips and zoom
- Avoid common mistakes: truncated y-axis on bars, dual y-axes, overplotting, missing units, default titles, excess decimal places

<details><summary>Example usage</summary>

"This dashboard has 15 charts and stakeholders say it is overwhelming" -- Audits for redundancy, groups remaining charts by business domain, moves detail charts to drill-down pages, keeps 6 key metrics on the main view, and adds a summary card row at the top with KPIs and sparklines.

### feature-engineering

> Feature engineering for ML including encoding, imputation, scaling, selection, and time-series features. Use when preparing data for ML models, selecting features, or engineering new features from raw data.

**Triggers:** Preparing data for ML models, encoding categorical variables, handling missing data, creating new features, selecting features, building time-series features
**Tools:** `Bash(python:*) Read Write`
**References:** None

Key capabilities:

- Encode categorical variables: one-hot (< 15 values), ordinal (natural order), target encoding (high cardinality, cross-validated), frequency encoding
- Handle missing data: understand missingness mechanism (MCAR/MAR/MNAR), median/mode imputation, binary indicator columns, KNN/MICE for correlated features
- Scale features: StandardScaler for linear models, MinMaxScaler for neural networks, RobustScaler for outlier-heavy data; tree models need no scaling
- Select features: filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (L1, tree importance, permutation importance)
- Engineer time-series features: lag values, rolling statistics, seasonal extraction (hour/day/month with sin/cos encoding), difference features, expanding statistics
- Create text features: TF-IDF, count vectorizer, pre-trained embeddings, extracted features (length, sentiment, readability)
- Build interaction and derived features: multiplication, ratios, polynomial terms, domain-driven binning, log transforms
- Prevent data leakage: fit transformers on training data only, respect temporal ordering, use sklearn Pipeline

<details><summary>Example usage</summary>

"I have a dataset with user_id, city, purchase_amount, and timestamp. How should I engineer features?" -- Target-encodes city with cross-validated means, extracts day_of_week/hour/is_weekend from timestamp, creates lag features for previous purchase amounts per user, adds rolling 7-day and 30-day purchase means, and creates a days_since_last_purchase feature, all wrapped in a sklearn Pipeline.

### data-quality

> Data quality framework covering completeness, accuracy, consistency, validation rules, and data contracts. Use when implementing data validation, setting up data quality checks, or defining data contracts.

**Triggers:** Implementing data validation, setting up quality checks for pipelines, defining data contracts between teams, investigating data anomalies
**Tools:** `Bash Read Write`
**References:** None

Key capabilities:

- Evaluate data against six dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity
- Define validation rules: schema validation, range checks, format checks, referential integrity, business rules, freshness checks -- categorized by severity (error vs. warning)
- Detect anomalies: track metrics over time (row counts, null rates, distinct values), alert on threshold deviations, monitor distribution shifts and schema changes
- Define data contracts: formal agreements on schema, SLAs, quality thresholds, ownership -- versioned and machine-readable (JSON Schema, protobuf, YAML)
- Implement Great Expectations patterns: expectation suites per table, core expectations (row count, not null, unique, in set), pipeline integration
- Set up data observability: metadata instrumentation, lineage graphs, health dashboards, automated root cause analysis
- Place quality checks at pipeline boundaries with stored results, configurable thresholds, and the five critical checks (row count, null rate, duplicate rate, freshness, schema match)

<details><summary>Example usage</summary>

"Set up data quality checks for our customer table" -- Implements checks across all six dimensions: completeness (null rate for email, name, created_at), uniqueness (customer_id has no duplicates), validity (email matches regex, status in allowed enum), consistency (country matches postal code format), timeliness (most recent created_at within 24 hours), and accuracy (spot check against CRM export).
