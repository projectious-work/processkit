  Navigation aid for the processkit skill catalog — maps natural-language
  cues and task types to the right skill. Read this when you are unsure
  which skill applies to the current task, when the user names a task
  without naming a skill, or at session start when orienting to an
  unfamiliar project. Always the first skill to consult; never the last.

# Skill Finder

## Intro

When you are unsure which skill to use, start here. This skill maps
what the user is asking for to the skill that handles it. It is not a
skill you invoke to do work — it is a skill you read to decide what to
invoke next.

## Overview

### By trigger phrase

Find the phrase that most closely matches what the user said, then load
that skill before proceeding.

### How to use a skill

Once you have identified the right skill:

1. Read the skill's `SKILL.md` — start with the **Intro** (3 sentences) to
   confirm it is the right match. If yes, read **Overview** for the workflow.
2. Follow the skill's instructions, adapting to the project's specific context.
3. Use **Full reference** only for edge cases or field-by-field specs.
4. If the skill has an MCP server (`mcp/SERVER.md`), its tools are available
   as function calls — the skill's Overview section describes when to use them.

If no skill in this index matches, check `skills/INDEX.md` for the full
catalog, or use `skill-builder` to author a new skill for the gap.

## Gotchas

- **Loading this skill every time instead of once.** skill-finder is an
  orientation aid, not a workflow skill. Read it once to identify the right
  skill, then load that skill and work from it. Do not keep skill-finder
  loaded alongside the working skill — it consumes context without adding
  value once you have identified the skill to use.
- **Treating the trigger-phrase table as exhaustive.** The table maps common
  phrases; it is not a complete index of all 120+ skills. If no phrase
  matches, scan the by-category section or read `skills/INDEX.md`. If
  the task is genuinely novel, use `skill-builder` to create a skill for it.
- **Skipping skill-finder when the task is "obvious."** The most common
  mistake is loading a skill by name from memory and discovering mid-task
  that the skill does not quite fit. Thirty seconds with the trigger-phrase
  table prevents an incorrect skill invocation. Default to checking even for
  familiar task types.
- **Using the category labels to filter instead of the trigger phrases.**
  The categories help humans browse; agents should match on trigger phrases,
  not category names. "Code quality" does not tell you whether to load
  `code-review`, `refactoring`, or `tdd-workflow` — the trigger phrase does.
- **Not updating skill-finder when new skills are added.** When a new skill
  is added to the catalog, add its trigger phrases to the table and its
  one-liner to the appropriate category. skill-finder is only reliable if
  it is kept current. The `skill-builder` skill includes a reminder to
  update this index.
- **Confusing skill-finder with skill-builder.** skill-finder helps you
  find an existing skill. skill-builder helps you create a new one. If
  skill-finder returns no match, the correct next step is `skill-builder`,
  not a general-purpose attempt to solve the task without a skill.
- **Ignoring the `core: true` intent when customising skill packages.**
  Until aibox enforces `core: true` in the install pipeline, project owners
  who configure `[skills].include` must add `skill-finder` explicitly.
  Omitting it means agents lose the navigation aid exactly when the catalog
  is most customised and therefore hardest to navigate.

## Full reference

### The `core: true` flag

The `core: true` field in this skill's frontmatter is a **proposed**
convention. It signals intent: this skill should be installed unconditionally,
regardless of `[skills].include` or `[skills].exclude` configuration in
`aibox.toml`.

**Current status:** the flag is present in the frontmatter as documentation.
aibox does not yet enforce it — a companion aibox issue will land the
`content_install.rs` change. Until then, project owners must include
`skill-finder` in any explicit `[skills].include` list.

**Why it matters:** a project owner who limits the installed skills to a
curated subset has, by definition, the most non-obvious skill catalog. That
is precisely when skill-finder is most needed. A skill that can be excluded
provides weaker guarantees than one that cannot.

### Keeping this index current

When adding a new skill to processkit:
1. Add 1–3 trigger phrases to the trigger-phrase table
2. Add a one-liner under the appropriate category in the by-category section
3. If no existing category fits, add a new category

The `skill-builder` skill includes a step reminding the author to update
skill-finder. The `skill-reviewer` skill checks that skill-finder has been
updated.
