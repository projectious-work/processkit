# Migration: disabled AI-harness state cleanup

> **SAFETY: Do not execute host actions automatically.**
> **Discuss the cleanup with the project owner before applying it.**

**Status:** pending

## Summary

One or more AI harnesses that previously had state on the host are no longer listed in `[ai].harnesses`. Their `.aibox-home` config directories and MCP-registration files are still on disk.

`aibox apply` did NOT delete this state because `[apply].purge_disabled_harness_state` is `false` (the default).

## What would be removed

### claude (claude no longer enabled)

- `.aibox-home/.claude`

## How to apply this cleanup

1. Review the list above with the project owner.
2. Either:
   - re-enable the harness in `aibox.toml` if the removal was unintentional, OR
   - set `[apply].purge_disabled_harness_state = true` in `aibox.toml` and run `aibox apply` again.
3. Move this file to `context/migrations/applied/` once handled.
