# DISC-001: Context System Redesign

## 1. Problem Statement

aibox's context system uses markdown tables (BACKLOG.md, DECISIONS.md,
PROJECTS.md) as the source of truth for structured data. This approach has
reached its limits:
- Editing structured records in markdown tables is fragile and error-prone
- A single BACKLOG.md file with 70+ rows creates merge conflicts for
  collaborators
- No efficient query/search capability (grep is the only option)
- Growing research corpus (27+ reports) is hard to navigate
- No way to enforce state machines, validate references, or compute metrics

Meanwhile, process framework research (SAFe, PMBOK, CMMI, IPMA) reveals that
all frameworks share universal primitives — and aibox should provide these as
building blocks.

## 2. Train of Thought

### 2.1 Starting point: Process model retrospective

We began by asking: do our process templates (minimal/managed/research/product)
still make sense? This led to the deeper question: what are the universal
building blocks that ALL process frameworks share?

### 2.2 Process ontology discovery

Research identified **15 universal process primitives** that appear across 7
domains (software, manufacturing, healthcare, legal, supply chain, knowledge
management, quality):

1. Work Item — unit of work (task/story/issue/ticket/card/case)
2. Log Entry / Event — immutable record of something that happened
3. Decision Record — choice with rationale
4. Artifact — any produced output
5. Role — named set of responsibilities
6. Process / Workflow — sequence of steps with decision points
7. State Machine — set of states with allowed transitions
8. Category / Taxonomy — classification system
9. Cross-Reference / Relation — typed link between entities
10. Checkpoint / Gate — validation point
11. Metric / Measure — quantified observation
12. Schedule / Cadence — time-based trigger
13. Scope / Container — boundary grouping related items
14. Constraint — rules/limits that restrict degrees of freedom
15. Context / Environment — ambient knowledge and conditions

**Key insight:** Every primitive shares the same meta-structure: identifier,
name, description, state, timestamps, owner, categories, cross-references.
This is a universal schema.

### 2.3 Storage architecture debate

**Question:** Should structured data move from markdown tables to a database?

**Owner's core principle:** Data must have ONE source of truth. Dual-master
never works — it leads to divergence, contradictions, merge conflicts, and
becomes impossible to manage.

**Arguments for database (SQLite):**
- Efficient queries (SQL vs parsing markdown)
- RAG integration (vector embeddings in same storage)
- State machine enforcement
- Cross-reference validation
- Metrics computation

**Arguments against database:**
- NOT git-native (binary blob, no meaningful diffs)
- Not human-readable without tooling
- Single source of truth principle violated if both markdown and DB exist
- Git delta compression doesn't work well for SQLite (page-based format)
- Size estimate: even small project database could reach 5-50MB per commit

**Git and binary files — the facts** (from `context-database-architecture`
research): Git does NOT delta-compress binary files efficiently in loose object
storage. Packfiles do apply binary delta compression, but SQLite's page-based
format means even small changes shuffle many pages — deltas are large. A 5MB
SQLite file changed 100 times could consume 200-500MB of git history. SQLite
as committed source of truth is not viable.

**Arguments for markdown+frontmatter (file-per-entity):**
- Git-native (perfect diffs, blame, merge)
- Human-readable
- Flexible schema via YAML `custom:` field
- Already proven pattern (SKILL.md files)
- Each entity = own file → minimal merge conflicts
- Single source of truth = the .md file

**NoSQL / document store exploration** (owner-initiated):
Owner asked: would NoSQL be better than SQL for flexible schemas
(user-defined fields)? Jira uses EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) for custom
fields — flexible but notoriously slow at scale. Options researched:
- JSON-per-entity files (git-native, but less readable than markdown)
- TinyDB, LowDB, UnQLite (embedded document stores — not git-native)
- SurrealDB embedded (multi-model, Rust-native — promising but immature)
- SQLite with JSON columns (SQL + flexible fields — good query, bad git)
- Markdown+frontmatter with `custom:` map (best of all worlds)

**Jira comparison:** Jira's power is per-issue-type field configuration and
configurable workflows (state machines). Its pain is vendor lock-in and
performance at scale. Linear solved this by being opinionated with fewer custom
fields but faster queries. Our markdown+frontmatter approach gets Jira's
flexibility via the `custom:` YAML map without the EAV performance tax.

**Resolution:** Markdown+frontmatter as source of truth, SQLite as DERIVED
runtime index (gitignored). Rebuilt on sync. This gives git-native storage +
fast queries without dual-master problems.

**Two kinds of content identified:**
- **Narrative content** stays as markdown body: research reports, decision
  rationale, work instructions, session notes, SKILL.md instructions
- **Structured records** get YAML frontmatter: IDs, states, priorities, dates,
  categories, cross-references, custom fields

### 2.4 Scaling concerns

**The scaling question:** Can file-per-entity scale to very large projects?
This matters because aibox is intended as the basis for kaits (multi-agent
company simulator), which could generate many thousands of artifacts per
project.

**Current estimate (needs validation):**

| Scale | Files | Git | Filesystem | Index rebuild |
|-------|-------|-----|------------|---------------|
| Small (<1K) | trivial | trivial | trivial | <1s |
| Medium (1K-10K) | fine | fine | needs subdirs | 1-10s |
| Large (10K-50K) | slow status | needs sharding | slow | 10-60s |
| Very large (50K+) | breaks | breaks | breaks | minutes |

**Concern (owner):** 50K files already being "shaky" is worrying. kaits could
easily generate 50K+ artifacts for a single simulated company. We can't just
throw this problem over the fence to kaits — if aibox is the basis, aibox
needs to handle it.

**Hot/cold archiving:** Move completed/old items to compressed archives.
Reduces active file count. But how far does this scale? Research needed.

**Open questions:**
- Is there a middle ground between "all files" and "all database"?
- Could sharding (year/month subdirs) + hot/cold push the limit to 100K+?
- What do large git monorepos actually do? (Google, Microsoft — but they use
  custom VFS)
- Could git sparse checkout help? (only check out active items)
- Should kaits use a different storage layer entirely while maintaining
  aibox-compatible import/export?

### 2.5 ID generation

**Options discussed:**
- Sequential (BACK-001, BACK-002) — current approach, simple, human-friendly
- UUID-based (BACK-a7f3b2c1) — no coordination needed, scales to
  multi-collaborator
- Prefix-based (BACK-BG-042) — brittle, not scalable
- Lock file — doesn't scale well for concurrent collaborators

**Leaning:** UUID-based. Owner can live with `BACK-a7f3b2c1` format. Lock
files and prefixes are brittle. Sequential is nice for small teams but breaks
with concurrent contributors.

**Alternative:** `aibox id --type backlog` as a central ID generator. But this
is just a local sequential counter — same coordination problem in distributed
setting.

**Decision pending.** Need to resolve as part of the storage architecture.

### 2.6 Mapping primitives to storage

**Not yet done.** Need to take the 15 identified primitives and map each to:
- File location in `context/` directory
- YAML frontmatter schema (required fields, optional fields, custom fields)
- State machine definition (allowed states and transitions)
- Relationships to other primitives
- Whether it's hot (filesystem) or could become cold (archive)

This is the next step in the discussion.

### 2.7 Scaling resolution

Research (`file-per-entity-scaling` research) resolved the scaling concern:

**Git handles 50K files comfortably** with three mitigations:
1. Directory sharding (`items/2026/03/BACK-xxx.md`) — keeps each dir under
   1K files
2. Git fsmonitor + `feature.manyFiles` — daemon tracks changes, avoids
   stat-ing all files
3. Sparse checkout — all files in git, only "hot" ones on disk

**Three-tier architecture:**
- Hot (filesystem, git-tracked): individual .md files for active items
- Warm (SQLite, gitignored): derived index for queries + RAG embeddings
- Cold (compressed archives, git-lfs): completed items older than threshold

**kaits boundary:** Repo-per-project. Each simulated company project = own git
repo with own aibox context (max ~50K active files). kaits orchestrates across
repos and maintains a cross-project database for analytics. aibox markdown =
interchange format.

**Ultimate mitigation (owner):** The underlying filesystem can be changed from
disk-based to RAM-based (tmpfs/ramfs). This eliminates all I/O bottlenecks but
is the nuclear option — only for extreme performance-critical scenarios.

**Decision (tentative):** File-per-entity with sharding + sparse checkout +
hot/cold archiving. Scales to 100K+ items per project. kaits scales beyond via
repo-per-project.

### 2.8 Discussion as a primitive

A Discussion IS a process primitive (this document is proof). It has: ID,
title, participants, status (active/concluded), related items, research
references, and produces decisions. Added as 16th primitive alongside the 15
from the ontology research.

### 2.9 UUID for identifiers

**Decision (tentative):** Use short UUIDs (first 8 hex chars of UUID4) for all
entity IDs. Format: `BACK-a7f3b2c1`, `DEC-f290e4b3`, `DISC-001` (discussions
keep sequential for now since they're rare and human-authored).

Rationale: no coordination needed for multi-collaborator, collision probability
negligible at 100K items (~0.0002%), human-readable enough. Lock files and
prefixes rejected as brittle.

### 2.10 Primitive mapping exercise

Completed in `context/research/primitive-mapping-exercise-2026-03.md`. Mapped
all 16 primitives to file locations, YAML schemas, state machines, and storage
tiers. Identified three storage patterns: file-per-entity markdown (11
primitives), JSONL append-only (events), and YAML configuration (state
machines, categories). Plus two structural primitives with no dedicated storage
(cross-references inline, context = directory itself).

### 2.11 Open questions resolved (session 2026-03-27 continued)

**Q1 — ID migration:** Full migration of all existing IDs to new format. No
backward compatibility, no mixed formats. Clean break.

**Q2 — People vs Roles (OWNER.md / TEAM.md):** Owner identified a gap in the
ontology: the Role primitive says "roles are not people," but OWNER.md and
TEAM.md describe PEOPLE so that AI agents know who they're working with. Two
distinct concepts identified:
- **Role** = a hat (responsibilities, permissions). "Product Owner" is a role.
- **Actor** = a person or agent (preferences, expertise, working style).
  "@alice" is an actor.
Relationship: actors FILL roles. One actor, many roles. One role, many actors.

**Decision (tentative):** Actor becomes a 17th primitive. Justification: the
separation is real, kaits needs rich actor profiles for simulated
humans/agents, and "who can fill this role" vs "what is this person like" are
fundamentally different questions. Content from OWNER.md and TEAM.md migrates
to Actor entities. OWNER.md and TEAM.md are retired — no legacy files, full
migration.

**Q3 — Event log format:** JSONL confirmed. Industry standard for log files.
Owner raised archiving implications: when events move from hot (JSONL files)
to cold (tar.gz archives), the SQLite index must be updated to point to the
archive location. Agreed approach:
- Index retains event METADATA (id, timestamp, type, subject) permanently
- Storage location field updated to point to archive path
- Full event payload requires archive extraction (slow, acceptable for history
  queries)
- Rotating logfile practices (space savings) covered by directory sharding +
  archiving

**Q4 — Artifact self-description:** Owner concern: "today I go to
context/research/ and find everything. In future, do I need the index?"
Resolution: TWO kinds of artifacts:
1. **Content-primary** (research, work instructions, PRD) — stay in semantic
   directories (research/, work-instructions/), gain frontmatter, index picks
   them up by scanning
2. **Metadata-primary** (build records, external references) — go to
   items/artifact/
The directory structure serves BOTH purposes: index storage AND
human-browsable organization. Not everything moves to items/. Semantic paths
are preserved for human discoverability.

**Q5 — Process definitions vs instances:** Confirmed class/object analogy.
Definitions (stable, low-volume) stay in items/process/ or
templates/processes/. Instances (ephemeral, high-volume) are modeled as Work
Items with `subtype: process-instance` and `process_def: PROC-xxx` reference.
Avoids duplicating Work Item lifecycle machinery.

**Q6 — ID prefix consistency:** Deferred — folded into broader ID format
discussion (§2.12).

### 2.12 ID format: word-based identifiers

Owner requested investigation of human-readable alternatives to hex UUIDs.
Motivated by: readability, memorability, speakability in standups. References:
zellij session naming, what3words.

**Analysis of hex UUID minimum lengths:**
- 6 hex chars (16M combinations): ~0.03% collision at 100K items — practical
  minimum
- 7 hex chars: ~0.002% — comfortable
- 8 hex chars: ~0.0001% — very safe at 1M items

**Word-based alternative:** A curated wordlist of ~2,000 short English words
(3-6 chars):
- 2 words: 4M combinations (≈ 6 hex chars) — `BACK-swift-oak`
- 3 words: 8B combinations (≈ 8 hex chars) — `BACK-swift.oak.bell`
- 2 words + 2-3 hex suffix: 16B combinations — `BACK-swift-oak-7f`

**Decision (tentative):** 2-word IDs from a curated wordlist. `BACK-swift-oak`
is vastly more usable than `BACK-a7f3b2c1`. Wordlist: ~10KB embedded in CLI
binary, filtered for short, common, non-offensive, unambiguously spelled words.
4M combinations sufficient for any single project. Collision handling: if
collision detected on generation, regenerate.

### 2.13 Kubernetes-inspired object model

Owner proposed adopting Kubernetes patterns: `apiVersion`, `kind`,
metadata/spec separation. Already precedent in codebase — addon YAML system
uses declarative patterns, and ARCHITECTURE.md describes a "declare desired
state, let controllers reconcile" philosophy.

**Adopted patterns:**
- `apiVersion: aibox/v1` — schema versioning. Enables migration when schemas
  change. Old files declare their version, can be migrated programmatically.
- `kind: WorkItem` — unambiguous type declaration. PascalCase per Kubernetes
  convention.
- `metadata:` — system fields (id, timestamps, labels/tags,
  annotations/custom)
- `spec:` — entity-specific fields (title, state, owner, refs, etc.)

**Not adopted:**
- `namespace:` — we use `scope:` which is more general
- `status:` as separate section — agents update state directly in spec
- `metadata.managedFields` — too complex for file-based storage

**Key insight — declarative reconciliation model:**
- Entity files = declared desired state
- sync = reconciliation loop (rebuild index, validate refs, enforce state
  machines)
- Events = imperative record of what actually happened
- The gap between desired state and actual state is what agents work to close

### 2.14 State machines: agent-driven vs server-driven

Owner insight: Jira executes state machines as a deterministic server
automaton. In aibox/kaits, agents are probabilistic — they INTERPRET the state
machine as guidance. This is a genuine advantage:
- State machine YAML defines what is ALLOWED, not what will happen
- Agent decides WHEN and HOW to transition based on context
- Guards are advisory checks, not hard server-side gates
- The system is more flexible/reliable than Jira's rigid automation

**Transition hooks — two mechanisms agreed:**
1. **Shell command field** (Kubernetes pod-spec `command:` style): runs a
   shell command on transition. stdout → event data, stderr → logged, exit
   code → success/failure. Enables webhooks via curl. No embedded scripting
   languages (too slow, hard to debug).
2. **Minijinja for guard expressions:** Already a dependency (used for
   Dockerfile/compose generation). Entity frontmatter fields become template
   variables. Easy to implement, understand, and debug — render the template
   to see the result.

Owner explicitly rejected: arbitrary Groovy-style scripting. Rationale: slow,
complicated to debug even for agents. Shell commands + minijinja cover the
needed functionality.

### 2.15 Filesystem sharding configurability

Agreed: sharding granularity configurable per entity type in aibox.toml.
Strategies: none, yearly, monthly, weekly, daily. Changing strategy is
non-destructive — existing files stay in place, new files use new strategy,
index knows actual paths. `aibox migrate-shards` can reorganize existing files
optionally.

### 2.16 Three-level rule + directory INDEX.md

All entity markdown files must follow the three-level rule from SKILL.md
pattern: YAML frontmatter → Level 1 intro (1-3 sentences) → Level 2 overview
→ Level 3 details.

Additionally, each directory gets an INDEX.md (or _index.md) serving as
"Level 0":
- Describes the directory's content and purpose
- Lists contents with one-line descriptions
- Allows AI agents to decide whether to drill deeper before reading files
- Auto-generated/updated by sync, with human-authored overrides supported

### 2.17 Filename conventions

Owner practices that should become standard:
1. **Inverse date prefix** for temporal sorting: `20260327-` or
   `20260327-1234-`. Applies to: research reports, session notes, events —
   anything where "when" matters.
2. **Content slug** for human scanning: `-process-ontology-primitives.md`.
   Applies to: research, discussions, work instructions.
3. **For entity files with word-IDs:** The word-ID IS the content hint.
   `BACK-swift-oak.md` is already memorable. Optionally add title slug:
   `BACK-swift-oak-implement-oauth.md` — ID + slug for browsing.

### 2.18 Template overrides (Kubernetes-inspired)

How to manage project-specific adaptations of base templates:
- **Template** (base) lives in `templates/processes/code-review.md`
- **Project override** declares `extends: templates/processes/code-review`
  and specifies only the delta (Kustomize overlay pattern)
- **Effective process** = base + overlay, computed at read time
- For agent migration briefings: diff `apiVersion: aibox/v1` vs `aibox/v2`
  schemas to produce a migration guide of what changed

### 2.19 Primitive overlaps and layering

Owner asked about overlaps between Work Item, Log Entry, Decision Record.
Resolution: not overlap but INHERITANCE. All primitives share a base schema
(id, type, title, description, state, timestamps, owner, tags, refs, custom).
Each primitive extends with type-specific fields. Distinguished by semantics
and lifecycle, not data structure.

**Primitive layers (from ontology research §6):**
- Layer 0 (irreducible core): Work Item, Log Entry, State Machine, Role,
  Actor*
- Layer 1 (structural): Scope, Cross-Reference, Category
- Layer 2 (process): Process, Checkpoint, Artifact, Schedule
- Layer 3 (governance): Decision Record, Metric, Constraint, Context,
  Discussion

*Actor added as new primitive.

**Risk handling:** Not a new primitive. A risk = Work Item (subtype: risk) +
Decision Record for mitigation choice + Category dimensions for
probability/impact.

**Artifact scope clarified:** Primary artifacts = project outputs (CLI binary,
container images, docs). Context documents = secondary artifacts (working
documents that support the process). Both get frontmatter, but
research/work-instructions stay in semantic directories.

### 2.20 Actor primitive — multi-actor roles confirmed

Owner confirmed: a Role can be filled by multiple Actors simultaneously.
"Julie and David share PM responsibilities without exact delineation" is a
valid real-world pattern. The `filled_by:` field is an array, no sub-division
required. If actors want to split explicitly, they create sub-roles. If they
share fuzzily, one role with multiple actors.

Actor types: `human` | `ai-agent`. For kaits, Actor profiles for AI agents
would describe capabilities, model, context window size, tool access — the
agent equivalent of expertise and working style.

### 2.21 Word-based IDs — petname crate and wordlist sizing

Research found the `petname` Rust crate (1.16M downloads) as the best
candidate:
- Supports custom word lists, configurable separators, word count
- Default nouns are animal names (inherently safe/non-offensive)
- Adjectives curated toward positive/neutral words
- Already in Rust ecosystem, well-maintained

**Wordlist sizing with 3-8 char words:**
- ~5,000 adjectives x ~4,000 nouns = **20M combinations** with just 2 words
- Far exceeds the 4M+ target — no hex suffix or third word needed

**Decision (tentative):** Use `petname` crate with custom filtered wordlist.
2-word IDs from 3-8 char words. Format: `BACK-swift-oak`. ~20M combinations
per prefix type.

**Content slugs rejected as default:** Owner concern about slug staleness
(content changes, slug doesn't match). Word-ID IS the stable identifier.
Title field in frontmatter is the living description. INDEX.md per directory
provides browsability. No slug in filename.

### 2.22 ~~Guard expression execution — aibox CLI as controller~~ (SUPERSEDED by §2.25)

Owner challenge: who evaluates minijinja guard expressions? Agents don't have
minijinja.

**Resolution:** The aibox CLI is the execution point. New command:

```
aibox transition BACK-swift-oak --to in-review
```

The CLI: (1) reads entity frontmatter, (2) finds applicable state machine, (3)
renders minijinja guard with entity fields as context, (4) if guard passes:
updates state, emits event, runs on_transition shell command, (5) if guard
fails: returns error with reason.

The agent doesn't need to know minijinja exists. It calls `aibox transition`
and gets yes/no. This fits the Kubernetes analogy: agent = user running
`kubectl apply`, aibox CLI = API server + controller that validates and
reconciles.

Shell commands on transitions: also executed by `aibox transition` as
subprocess after state change. stdout → event data, stderr → logged, exit code
→ success/failure.

Fallback for agents without CLI access: guard expressions are readable as
natural language intent documentation. Agent can evaluate
`{{ blocked_count == 0 }}` by reading refs and counting blocks — probabilistic
but functional.

### 2.23 ~~Template overrides — materialization, not read-time computation~~ (SUPERSEDED by §2.26)

Owner challenge: "computed at read time" assumes an on_file_read handler.
Agents read raw files. Many LLMs have <200K context. There is no middleware
between the agent and the file.

**Revised model — materialization by sync:**

```
templates/processes/code-review.md            ← base (shipped with aibox)
context/overrides/processes/code-review.md    ← project delta (user-authored)
context/items/process/PROC-swift-oak.md       ← MATERIALIZED effective process
                                                (generated by aibox sync)
```

sync reads base + overlay, resolves, writes the effective file. The agent ONLY
reads the materialized file. This is how Kustomize works — you run `kustomize
build` to produce rendered YAML; the API server never reads kustomization.yaml.

**Override as entity (tentative):**
```yaml
apiVersion: aibox/v1
kind: Override
metadata:
  id: OVR-calm-pine
spec:
  base: templates/processes/code-review
  patches:
    - path: spec.gates
      op: add
      value: [GATE-bold-river]
```

**Is override a primitive?** No — it's an operation (sync), not a data
concept. Kubernetes doesn't treat "overlay" as a resource kind. The Override
entity is a configuration input, not a process primitive.

**Key separation:** Authoring time (human works with overrides) vs execution
time (agent reads materialized files). The override machinery is invisible to
agents at runtime.

### 2.24 Architectural boundary: aibox is infrastructure, not application

Owner's fundamental insight: aibox is like Kubernetes — it deploys and manages
the context infrastructure. It does NOT reach inside the derived project to
execute process logic.

**The boundary:**
- aibox = scaffolding + schema + validation + migration (infrastructure)
- Derived project agents = process execution + state management (application)

Once scaffolded, context files belong to the derived project. Agents read,
interpret, and modify them with full autonomy. aibox doesn't enforce, it
observes and validates.

**aibox commands (infrastructure):**
- `aibox init` — create context structure from templates
- `aibox sync` — rebuild index from files
- `aibox lint` — post-facto validate schema, references, state machine
  compliance
- `aibox validate` — check required fields, broken refs
- `aibox migrate` — generate migration diffs + prompts for schema updates
- `aibox id generate` — create new word-based IDs

**NOT in aibox (process layer):**
- Guard evaluation (agents interpret guards probabilistically)
- Transition enforcement (agents edit state directly; lint catches violations
  after)
- Hook/script execution (agents have their own tool access)
- Process orchestration
- RBAC enforcement (agents interpret permissions probabilistically)

### 2.25 Guards in plain English, not minijinja

Owner challenge: minijinja guards are deterministic thinking — we're building
a workflow engine when we have agents. If aibox is a differentiator to "old
world" tools, we should lean into the probabilistic model fully.

**Decision (revised):** Guard expressions are written in plain English, not
minijinja pseudo-code:

```yaml
transitions:
  - from: in-progress
    to: in-review
    guard: "Only transition when all blocking items are resolved and work is
            tested."
    on_transition:
      suggest: "Notify the reviewer role that a review is ready."
```

The agent reads this, evaluates it using judgment, and edits the entity file.
This is:
- Simpler (no expression language to implement)
- More flexible (agents apply judgment, handle edge cases)
- Consistent with agent-driven model (§2.14)
- A real differentiator (Jira can't do fuzzy guard evaluation)

Minijinja remains in aibox for template rendering (Dockerfiles, compose
files) — its existing use case. But NOT for process logic.

### 2.26 Overrides eliminated — direct editing + migration prompts

Owner challenge: if derived project agents can edit files directly, why have
an override mechanism? It adds deterministic complexity where probabilistic
simplicity suffices.

**Revised workflow:**
1. `aibox init` generates process definitions from templates into project's
   context/
2. Project owner tells agent: "Our code review requires 2 reviewers"
3. Agent edits the process file directly — it owns the file
4. No overlay, no base+delta, no materialization

**On aibox version updates:**
- `aibox migrate` generates a diff (old template → new template)
- Produces a migration prompt with instructions for the derived project's
  agent
- Agent applies changes with human approval
- Prompt includes: "Never edit without asking the user"

This mirrors real infrastructure upgrades: release notes + migration guide,
not automatic in-place patching. The derived project's customizations are
respected because the agent reviews the diff against the current state.

### 2.27 Shell commands as suggestions, not guarantees

In the probabilistic model, `on_transition.suggest` is guidance the agent MAY
follow:
- Agent has autonomy — it might execute the curl, or might not
- Derived project owner may have denied bash access
- Agent can substitute an equivalent action
- The event log records what actually happened, regardless

For deterministic needs (event recording), aibox provides dumb infrastructure
commands (`aibox event append`) that agents can call — but these are
infrastructure utilities, not process enforcement.

### 2.28 ~~Bash scripts / event append~~ (SUPERSEDED by §2.30)

Earlier proposals for `aibox event append` and skill-wrapped bash scripts are
superseded. See §2.30 for the clean model.

### 2.29 RBAC in plain English

Owner raised: who is allowed to edit what? User A (admin) can change the
release process, User B (developer) cannot. Should this be deterministic or
probabilistic?

**Decision (tentative):** Probabilistic RBAC via plain English in Role
definitions.

```yaml
kind: Role
spec:
  name: "Developer"
  permissions:
    - "Can create and edit work items assigned to you"
    - "Can comment on any work item"
    - "Can create and edit research documents"
  restrictions:
    - "Cannot modify process definitions, state machines, or gate criteria"
    - "Cannot change role assignments or role definitions"
    - "Cannot modify constraints or scheduling"
  escalation: "Ask an Admin role holder for changes outside your permissions"
```

The derived project's agent reads this, checks the requesting user's actor
profile → roles → permissions/restrictions, and makes a judgment call. This
works because:
- Real organizations are already probabilistic about authority
- Agents can handle edge cases (typo fix in process doc = probably fine)
- Deterministic RBAC can be routed around anyway (ask an admin to do it)
- The event log provides accountability for every decision

**Consequences and liability:**
- `aibox lint` flags permission anomalies post-facto ("PROC-xxx was modified
  by @user-b who holds Developer role, which restricts process modification")
- aibox assumes zero liability — RBAC definitions are guidance, not
  enforcement
- Derived project owner is responsible for consequences of their agents'
  decisions
- Event log provides full audit trail

**Permissions reference kind:** Restrictions naturally map to entity kinds:
"Cannot modify kind: Process, StateMachine, Gate, Constraint, Role"

### 2.30 Bash scripts and event recording — agents ARE the execution layer

Owner challenge: what's the point of `aibox event append`? And creating a
skill per bash script is unrealistic.

**Resolution: there is no hook execution infrastructure.** The agent IS the
execution layer.

When the state machine says `suggest: "Notify the reviewer"`, the agent
decides how to act on it. Maybe it posts a comment, sends a message, runs a
curl command, or does nothing. The agent already has its own tools (bash, file
editing, etc.) based on what the derived project owner has granted. No aibox
infrastructure needed.

If the suggestion says
`suggest: "Run: curl -X POST https://deploy.example.com/trigger"`, the agent
either has bash access and runs it, or doesn't and tells the user to run it
manually. This is exactly what a human team member would do without the right
credentials.

**Event recording — REVISED in §2.32.** The sync-based approach was wrong
(deterministic thinking). See §2.32 for the correct model.

### 2.31 Filename conventions refined

**Content-primary long-lived files** (research, decisions, discussions):
`<inverse-datetime>-<KIND>-<word-ID>-<content-slug>.md`
Example: `20260327-ART-swift-oak-process-ontology-primitives.md`
Slug acceptable because these files rarely change after creation.

**High-volume entity files** (work items, roles, schedules):
`<KIND>-<word-ID>.md`
Example: `BACK-swift-oak.md`
No slug, no date — date is in frontmatter + sharding path.

### 2.32 Event recording — agent logs via skill, aibox logs infrastructure

Owner correction: sync detecting state changes is deterministic thinking
again. Problems: (1) nothing runs sync deterministically, (2) multiple state
changes between syncs means intermediate events are lost (draft→ready→
in-progress seen as only draft→in-progress). Sync can't reconstruct history
it didn't witness.

**Correct model: two event sources.**

**Process events** (state changes, decisions, gate checks, comments):
- Agent logs these using an **event-log skill** (to be created by aibox)
- The skill is simple: append a JSONL line to the current month's event file
- The instruction to always log is placed prominently in scaffolded process
  documentation
- Whether the agent actually logs every time is probabilistic — derived
  project's responsibility
- If the derived project creates RBAC rules that trick the agent out of
  logging, that's on them

**Infrastructure events** (inconsistencies, lint warnings, schema errors,
sync results):
- `aibox sync` / `aibox lint` write these deterministically
- "Detected broken reference: BACK-swift-oak → BACK-bold-river (not found)"
- "Schema validation failed on PROC-calm-pine: missing required field 'kind'"
- "Index rebuilt: 347 entities, 12 warnings"

**The clean separation:**

| What | Who | How |
|---|---|---|
| Process events | Agent | Event-log skill (probabilistic) |
| Infrastructure events | aibox sync/lint | Direct JSONL append (deterministic) |
| Entity file edits | Agent | Direct file editing |
| Index maintenance | aibox sync | SQLite rebuild from files |

This makes the event log richer and more auditable: you see both what the
agent did (or claims it did) AND what aibox infrastructure observed.
Discrepancies between the two are themselves informative.

### 2.33 Skills as agent API to primitives

Every primitive needs a corresponding skill — the skill is the agent's API
that encodes mechanical correctness (file naming, frontmatter schema, JSONL
format, sharding path, three-level rule) so the agent can focus on judgment.

Full research in the primitive-skills-mapping research document.

**17 skills mapped to 17 primitives:**

| Primitive | Skill | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Work Item | `workitem` | Rewrite of `backlog-context` |
| Log Entry | `event-log` | New (critical, foundation) |
| Decision Record | `decision` | Rewrite of `decisions-adr` |
| Artifact | `artifact-tracking` | New |
| Actor | `actor-profile` | Rewrite of `owner-profile` |
| Role | `role-management` | New |
| Process | `process-management` | New |
| State Machine | `state-machine-management` | New |
| Category | `taxonomy-management` | New |
| Cross-Reference | (embedded in other skills) | N/A |
| Checkpoint | `gate-management` | New (extends `code-review`) |
| Metric | `metrics` | New |
| Schedule | `schedule-management` | New (extends `standup-context`) |
| Scope | `scope-management` | New |
| Constraint | `constraint-management` | New |
| Context | `context-archiving` | Existing (needs update) |
| Discussion | `discussion-management` | New |

**Cross-cutting concerns (not separate skills, embedded in all
entity-modifying skills):**
- RBAC checking: read actor → roles → permissions before every modification
- Event logging: log every action via `event-log` skill
- INDEX.md maintenance: update directory indexes after file changes

**Revised packages:** core (actor, role, event-log), tracking (workitem,
decision, archiving), processes (process, state-machine, gate), planning
(scope, schedule, estimation), governance (constraint, metrics, taxonomy),
collaboration (discussion, standup, handover, retro), artifacts
(artifact-tracking, documentation).

**Presets:** minimal (core), managed (core+tracking+collaboration), software
(managed+processes+code+architecture), full-product (everything).

**Implementation order:** event-log → workitem → decision → actor-profile →
role-management → process layer → planning/governance →
collaboration/lifecycle.

### 2.34 Skill design refinements

**Skill naming:** Use longer descriptive names (`workitem-management` not
`workitem`). Pattern: `<noun>-management` for CRUD skills, `<noun>-<verb>` for
action-specific skills.

**Skill hierarchy via instruction references:** Skills reference lower-layer
skills by name. `workitem-management` says "use event-log-management to log
this" and "use role-management to check permissions." The agent follows the
chain. Dependency is strictly downward — lower-layer skills never reference
higher-layer skills. Hierarchy documented in skill frontmatter via `uses:`
field.

```
Layer 0: event-log-management (foundation)
Layer 1: role-management, actor-profile-management
Layer 2: workitem-management, decision-record-management, scope-management
Layer 3: process-management, gate-management, schedule-management
Layer 4: discussion-management, metrics-management
```

**Skill size:** Keep one skill per primitive. Target 100-200 lines. Current
skills range 17-244 lines; 140 lines is the sweet spot (comparable to
`agent-management`). The three-level rule ensures agents read only what they
need. Split only if a skill exceeds ~250 lines.

**Human vocabulary mapping:** Each skill's "When to Use" section must list all
common human terms that map to the primitive. "Backlog item", "task", "ticket",
"issue", "bug", "story" all map to `workitem-management`. This ensures a human
saying "add a backlog item" triggers the right skill.

### 2.35 Template originals — scaffold + keep copies

`aibox init` creates project files AND stores original template copies:

```
context/.aibox/templates/
  v1.0.0/                     # originals from scaffold time
  v1.1.0/                     # downloaded by aibox update
context/.aibox/migration/
  v1.0.0-to-v1.1.0.md         # auto-generated diff + migration instructions
```

Derived project's agent can diff originals vs current files to understand
customizations. Migration prompts generated by `aibox migrate` reference these
copies. No deterministic override mechanism — just files the agent reads and
reasons about.

**Derived project skill customization:** Same principle — direct editing after
scaffolding. The originals in `.aibox/templates/` let the agent understand
what was changed if analysis is ever needed.

### 2.36 aibox / kaits logical split

**aibox = single-project infrastructure + process primitives + curated skills**
- Container environment, process ontology (17 primitives), skill library, CLI
  tooling
- Defines the WHAT (primitives), a little HOW (starter processes), and the
  vocabulary (apiVersion/kind, JSONL format, three-level rule, file naming)
- Single project scope: one git repo, one context directory, one team
- Terminal only

**kaits = multi-project orchestration + agent teams + company simulation**
- Orchestrates across many aibox repos (repo-per-project)
- Agent spawning, lifecycle, coordination
- Company structure (departments, OKRs, budgets, hiring)
- Cross-project database, analytics, portfolio view
- Graphical UI (dashboards, Kanban boards, agent status)
- Persistent processes (daemons for cadences, monitoring)
- Higher-level processes (PI planning, portfolio management, capacity
  allocation)

**Key insight:** aibox provides atoms (primitives), kaits builds molecules
(company processes) from those atoms. Solo developer uses aibox directly,
never needs kaits.

### 2.37 Process packages in the new primitive-based system

Packages define which primitives and skills are active. They don't define
processes — they activate the skills that enable processes.

| Package | Primitives/Skills active | Target user |
|---|---|---|
| minimal | Actor, Role, Event log | Quick experiments, throwaway |
| managed | + Work items, Decisions, Archiving, Standups, Handover | Solo dev, ongoing project |
| software | + Processes, State machines, Gates, Code/Arch skills | Solo/small team, software |
| research | + Artifact tracking, Documentation skills | Research, writing, analysis |
| full-product | + Scopes, Schedules, Constraints, Metrics, Taxonomy, Governance | Team, product dev, kaits |

aibox ships starter processes (code-review, bug-fix, feature-dev, release)
with the software and full-product packages. These are scaffolded as Process
entity files with plain English steps. Derived project customizes them.

### 2.38 The Process Paradox — resolved

**Paradox:** If aibox is infrastructure, it shouldn't define process. But
primitives without process are useless. Having work items implies SOME
workflow. Resolution:

**Three layers of process:**
1. **Primitive mechanics** (aibox — always): HOW to create/update files, log
   events, check RBAC. Skills encode this. Framework-agnostic. Like SQL is to
   a database.
2. **Micro-processes** (aibox — optionally): Code review, bug fix, release,
   feature dev. Small, self-contained, framework-neutral workflows. Every
   project needs these regardless of whether they call themselves "Scrum" or
   "Kanban."
3. **Macro-processes / frameworks** (kaits territory): SAFe, LeSS,
   Scrum@Scale, PMBOK, Disciplined Agile. Company-level operating models.
   Require multi-team coordination.

**Process packages are primitive activation tiers, NOT framework choices:**
- minimal = "you exist and can log" (almost no process implied)
- managed = "track work, record decisions" (no opinion on sprints vs flow)
- software = "do code review, handle bugs, manage releases" (micro-processes,
  not frameworks)
- full-product = all primitives active, ready for ANY framework on top

**aibox does NOT ship SAFe, Scrum, Kanban, etc.** Reasons: scope explosion,
too opinionated, wrong granularity (frameworks are organizational choices, not
project infrastructure), composability is more powerful. However, optional
community-contributed framework packages could be installed:
`aibox process install scrum-basic`.

**Personas and user stories fit existing primitives:**
- Persona = Actor (subtype: persona) — fictional user profile
- User story = Work Item (subtype: story) — "As X, I want Y, to achieve Z"
- These practices are universal (XP, Design Thinking), not SAFe-specific

### 2.40 Sector analysis and process package completeness

Research completed: 15 sectors analyzed, deep dive on scientific research.

**Key finding:** 17 primitives cover 70-80% of every sector. Sector
differences are primarily: constraints (regulatory), work item subtypes, and
cadences.

**Revised aibox core packages (Tier 1):**
- minimal, managed, software (unchanged)
- **research** — MAJOR expansion needed (current template critically incomplete
  for real scientific work: missing publication pipeline, IRB gates, literature
  management, protocol versioning, grant tracking, data management plans)
- **editorial** — NEW: content pipeline (draft→review→approve→publish),
  content calendar
- **consulting** — NEW: engagement tracking, deliverable management, handoff
  packages
- full-product (unchanged — all primitives active)

**Community/sector packs (Tier 2-3):** healthcare-pharma, financial-services,
legal-practice, construction-eng, nonprofit-grants, government-procurement,
manufacturing-quality, data-science-ml. Installable via
`aibox process install`.

### 2.41 Community process package interface

Process packages are git repos with a standard structure:

```
package.yaml        # apiVersion/kind metadata, requirements, provides
context/            # files to merge into project context/
skills/             # optional custom skills
README.md
```

Commands:
- `aibox process install <git-url>` — install a package
- `aibox process check <path>` — validate conformance
- `aibox process list` — list installed packages
- `aibox process export` — package project's process for sharing

Company-to-open-source flow: company customizes process with kaits agents →
agents iteratively improve → company exports and publishes → others install and
adapt. Like Anthropic Claude marketplace — community-driven, git-based.

### 2.42 Personas defined

6 personas created:
1. **Alex** — Solo developer, freelance, managed package
2. **Dr. Priya** — Research scientist, lab lead, research package
3. **Maria** — Small team lead, startup, software/full-product package
4. **Sam** — Consultant/contractor, engagement-focused, managed package
5. **kaits** — Company simulator, programmatic usage, full-product
6. **Jordan** — Content producer, editorial workflow, editorial package

Personas ARE Actor entities (subtype: persona) — dogfooding the primitive
system.

### 2.43 AI provider audit logging — hybrid event model

Research (ai-provider-audit-logging): Most major AI providers offer some audit
logging. Best: Claude Code (21 hook events, HTTP webhooks), Gemini CLI (native
OTel), Codex CLI (OTel). Worst: Cursor, Continue.dev.

**Three logging channels (the hybrid model):**
1. **Provider hooks (deterministic):** Captures WHAT happened — every tool
   call, file edit. Configured via aibox.toml `[audit]` section. Always logs
   if enabled.
2. **Agent event-log skill (probabilistic):** Captures WHY it happened —
   state changes, decisions, rationale. Best-effort, agent's responsibility.
3. **aibox sync/lint (deterministic):** Infrastructure events —
   inconsistencies, validation.

Together: the "what" is guaranteed, the "why" is best-effort. Complete audit
coverage.

Optional `[audit]` section in aibox.toml:
```toml
[audit]
provider_hooks = true
provider_destination = "context/audit/"
```

### 2.44 Software development deep dive — no new primitives needed

Research (software-dev-process-deep-dive): Full lifecycle analyzed from
product discovery through end-of-life. **17 primitives cover everything**
through composition. No gaps requiring new primitives.

Gaps that need attention (modeled as subtypes, not new primitives):
- Environments (dev/staging/prod) → Scope subtype
- Feature flags → Work Item subtype with per-environment state
- External dependencies → Artifact subtype
- Deployment history → Event type

**4 must-have missing process templates for software package:**
1. incident-response.md
2. technical-design.md
3. spike-research.md
4. hotfix.md

**6 state machines defined:** Feature, Bug, Incident, Release, Tech Debt,
PR/Code Review.

### 2.45 Naming consistency resolution

Audit found 2 inconsistencies: gate/checkpoint and scope/project. Resolved:
- **Gate** everywhere (directory `context/gate/`, kind `Gate`, prefix `GATE-`)
- **Scope** everywhere (prefix `SCOPE-` for all, not `PROJ-` vs `SCOPE-`)

**Directory naming revised:** Primitives get top-level dirs under `context/`
(not nested under `items/`). Directory name matches the primitive:
`context/work-item/`, `context/decision/`, `context/actor/`, etc.

**Filename convention revised — two patterns:**
- **Pattern A (human-named):** Low-volume, long-lived entities (Actor, Role,
  Process, Gate, Metric, Schedule, Constraint, Scope). Filename:
  `KIND-human-name.md`. Example: `ACTOR-alex-chen.md`, `ROLE-admin.md`,
  `PROC-code-review.md`. Word-ID lives in `metadata.id` inside YAML. CLI
  ensures name uniqueness.
- **Pattern B (auto-generated):** High-volume entities (Work Item, Decision,
  Discussion, Artifact). Filename: `KIND-word-id-content-slug.md`. Example:
  `BACK-calm-lark-dark-mode-toggle.md`, `DEC-keen-fox-use-postgresql.md`.
  Slug from title at creation, does NOT update if title changes.

### 2.46 INDEX.md — structural, not statistical

INDEX.md describes the directory's PURPOSE and SCHEMA, not its current state:
- What entity kind lives here
- What subtypes exist
- What state machine applies
- What skills manage it
- What the file naming pattern is

INDEX.md does NOT contain: item counts, state groupings, recent activity,
statistics. Those come from the SQLite index queries. INDEX.md only changes
when the schema changes, not when items are added. Auto-generated by
`aibox init`, updated by `aibox migrate`.

### 2.47 SQLite index from init onwards

`aibox init` creates the SQLite index database immediately (gitignored). Not
deferred to a later `aibox sync`. The index is empty but ready from the start.
`aibox sync` keeps it current. This means queries work from the first session.

### 2.48 Human identity resolution (Kubernetes-inspired)

Research (ai-provider-identity-scheduling): Identity varies dramatically across
providers. Claude Code uses OAuth, Copilot uses GitHub, Aider has NO identity,
self-hosted LLMs have no auth by default.

**Solution: kubeconfig-inspired local identity file.**

`~/.aibox/identity.toml` (per-user, per-machine, NEVER committed):
```toml
[identity]
name = "Bob Smith"
email = "bob@company.com"
handle = "bob"
[preferences]
communication_style = "..."
working_hours = "CET 09:00-17:00"
```

**Identity cascade:**
1. `~/.aibox/identity.toml` (most reliable, works with ANY provider)
2. Environment variable: `AIBOX_USER=bob@company.com`
3. AI provider identity (if extractable: GitHub, Google accounts)
4. Git config: `git config user.email`
5. `aibox auth whoami` — displays resolved identity + provider
6. Agent asks (last resort)

Multi-human repos: Actor files contain non-sensitive shared info only.
Personal preferences in `~/.aibox/identity.toml` (never committed). Follows
Kubernetes pattern: kubeconfig (local) vs RBAC bindings (shared).

**Full RBAC flow (3-layer model):**
1. Machine layer: `~/.aibox/identity.toml` → "I am Bob" (never committed)
2. Repository layer: `context/actor/ACTOR-bob-smith.md` → "Bob is on this
   project, fills Developer role" + `context/role/ROLE-developer.md` →
   permissions/restrictions
3. Runtime: Agent resolves identity → Actor → Roles → holds permissions in
   memory. On every modifying action: check permissions, if denied → explain +
   escalation path.

Actor types: human (identity.toml), ai-agent (env var / kaits), service
(CI/CD env var). Permission model: additive (any role granting permission
wins). Restrictions checked across all roles. Multi-role actors get union of
permissions.

Detailed elaboration with diagrams and multi-actor scenarios in the personas
and scenarios appendix (Scenario 5 and following sections).

### 2.49 Validation scenarios walked through (full detail)

Complete walkthroughs in the DISC-001 personas appendix. All 10 scenarios
walked through in detail with 6 personas. Key findings:

Issues found across scenarios:
- "Check schedules at session start" needs prominent CLAUDE.md placement
  (high)
- Research package missing schedule-management (high)
- INDEX.md essential at scale >50 items, auto-generated by aibox sync (high)
- Agent identity from git config + env var override (high)
- Agent should adapt formality (no discussion entity for trivial choices)
  (medium)
- Migration prompts must be agent-agnostic (medium)
- `aibox id generate --count N` batch mode for kaits (medium)

### 2.50 aiadm/aictl architectural proposal (session 2026-03-28)

Owner identified that the purely probabilistic RBAC model (Decision 19) is
insufficient for enterprise: CIOs and security responsibles need deterministic
enforcement and tamper-proof audit logs, not agent goodwill.

**Proposed solution (Kubernetes-inspired):**
- Rename `aibox` -> `aiadm` (like kubeadm): infrastructure setup, images,
  containers, schema
- New CLI `aictl` (like kubectl): ALL context operations
  (create/get/describe/delete/edit/apply)
- Certificate-based authentication: each user/agent has a cert signed by
  project CA
- OS-level file lockdown: context/ writable only by aictl process
- Deterministic audit log: every aictl command logged automatically
- RBAC mechanically enforced: no certificate = no access

**Research conducted** (aiadm-aictl-architecture research):

1. **OS-level lockdown:** Assessed 5 mechanisms (DAC, SELinux/AppArmor,
   capabilities, container isolation, FUSE). Key finding: no intra-container
   mechanism is absolute against root shell access. Host-applied AppArmor is
   strongest. Recommended layered approach: DAC + cryptographic signing + FUSE
   when budget allows.

2. **kubectl->aictl mapping:** 24 commands map 1:1, 4 adapted semantically,
   12 new aictl-specific commands (transition, lint, sync, search, board, tree,
   etc.), 16 kubectl commands moved to aiadm. Total ~40 aictl commands.

3. **Decision impact:** Of 50 decisions: 14 unchanged, 17 modified, 7
   superseded, 12 strengthened. Superseded cluster around identity/RBAC (19,
   43, 47, 48) and execution model (9, 20, 21, 35). Key boundary shift:
   aiadm=infrastructure, aictl=tooling, agents=judgment.

4. **K8s certificate flow:** Detailed analysis of CA creation, CSR workflow,
   kubeconfig, service accounts, RBAC mechanics. Key insight: enforcement works
   because API server is the single choke point to etcd. For aictl: signed
   files + git hook enforcement is the practical equivalent.

**Key architectural insight:** The probabilistic paradigm survives as a LAYER
on top of a deterministic base. aictl handles mechanical correctness (auth,
RBAC, schema, logging); agents handle judgment (what to create, when to
transition, how to interpret guards). Skills shrink by 60-70% because
cross-cutting concerns become automatic.

**Open questions for owner:** (1) Does aictl govern all context/ files or only
entities with frontmatter? (2) Guard evaluation: trust agent assertion or
evaluate mechanically? (3) Solo dev certificate complexity — is `--no-auth`
mode sufficient? (4) Rename timing. (5) Structured vs plain-English
permissions. (6) Daemon vs CLI-only.

### 2.51 Authorization design — process protection (session 2026-04-01)

Owner review of aiadm/aictl proposal identified a critical attack vector: a
developer modifies process definitions locally (e.g., `process/release.md` →
"no approvals needed"), the AI agent reads the modified process and executes
accordingly, then the developer reverts the process files. Git history looks
clean. Filesystem write-blocking would prevent this, but the research showed
that intra-container filesystem protection is fundamentally limited against
agents with root shell access.

**Key realization:** In the classic world, process documents (wiki pages,
Confluence) never enforced anything. Enforcement came from CI/CD pipelines
(compiled logic), branch protection (server-side), required approvals
(server-side state), and deployment keys (held by the pipeline). The process
document was documentation of what the pipeline enforces, not the enforcement
itself.

**The root problem in aibox:** Process definitions (markdown) and enforcement
mechanism (agent reading that markdown) live in the same trust domain. The
agent reads its instructions from a location the governed party can edit. This
is like letting the CI/CD pipeline download its rules from a wiki page the
developer can edit mid-run.

**Resolution — signed process definitions + hash pinning:**

Process definitions remain markdown in git (human-readable, versioned,
recoverable). But they are consumed through a verification layer, not trusted
raw.

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Signing | `aibox process sign release.md` | Process-admin signs with their cert |
| Pinning | `.aibox/process-pins.toml` (signed) | Records expected hash per process file |
| Verification | `aibox release start` | Verifies process file hash against pin |
| Audit | Event log | Records which process hash was used at execution time |

The local-modify-then-revert attack fails because the modified file's hash
doesn't match the signed pin. `aibox` refuses to execute against an unsigned
or hash-mismatched process definition. The developer CAN modify the file
locally — aibox just won't trust it.

**Separation aligns with volume classification (Decision 40):**

| Category | Entities | Authorization |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Governance (low-volume) | Process, Role, Gate, Constraint, Scope | Signed by process-admin, pinned hash |
| Governed (high-volume) | WorkItem, Decision, Discussion, Artifact | Normal RBAC (create/edit/delete per role) |
| Audit (append-only) | Event log entries | Append only, signed, hash-chained |

The low-volume/high-volume distinction already made for naming conventions
(Decision 40) turns out to be the same distinction needed for the trust model.

**Git submodules as escalation path:** For teams, governance files (processes,
roles, gates, constraints) can live in a separate repo with different push
permissions. The submodule pin (commit hash) is the version reference.
Updating the pin requires a visible commit. This is the natural Tier 1→2
scaling step (see §2.52).

### 2.52 Event log scaling — tiered architecture (session 2026-04-01)

Owner challenged the git-based event log design at scale. With 10 developers
generating events concurrently, the push-pull cycle creates cascade failures:

```
Developer A pushes → success
Developer B pushes → rejected (not fast-forward)
Developer B pulls, rebases, pushes → rejected (C pushed)
Developer C pushes → rejected (B just pushed)
... cascade of rebase-push-retry
```

Even per-actor JSONL sharding (each actor appends to their own file) doesn't
solve this: the push frequency problem remains for all shared files. Git was
designed for collaborative authoring (low-frequency edits to existing
content), not event streaming (high-frequency appends of new content).

**Principle reframe:** The actual principle is "everything is auditable and
recoverable," not "everything is in git." Git is the zero-infrastructure
default implementation that provides auditability for free. A properly
configured database with WAL archiving, replication, and access controls
provides the same five properties:

1. Auditable — every mutation attributable and immutable
2. Recoverable — nothing permanently lost
3. Versionable — can see what changed and roll back
4. Human-readable — exportable to readable format
5. Portable — no vendor lock-in, no mandatory infrastructure

**Tiered architecture:**

| Tier | Target | Event storage | Governance | Artifacts | CLI |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|-----|
| 0 (Solo) | Alex persona | JSONL in git (per-actor) | Same repo | Same repo | `aibox` |
| 1 (Small team) | Maria persona | JSONL in git (per-actor) | Separate repo (submodule/pin) | Project repo | `aibox` |
| 2 (Medium team) | Growing company | External store (Redis/Postgres/ClickHouse) | Governance repo | Project repo | `aibox` |
| 3 (Enterprise/kaits) | CIO persona | Full event infrastructure | Company-wide governance repo | Per-team repos | `aibox` + kaits |

**The "everything in git" principle bends at Tier 2.** But it bends at exactly
the point where git's write pattern stops matching the data's write pattern.
Governance and artifacts are low-frequency, high-semantic — git is ideal.
Events are high-frequency, low-semantic — git is the wrong tool.

**Append-only in git (Tiers 0-1):**

Per-actor JSONL sharding avoids merge conflicts:
```
context/events/
  actor-alice.jsonl     ← Alice's agent only appends here
  actor-bob.jsonl       ← Bob's agent only appends here
  infrastructure.jsonl  ← aibox system events
```

Server-side pre-receive hooks enforce: lines can only be appended, never
removed (diff must be pure additions). Each line signed. Works for up to ~10
concurrent actors.

### 2.53 Responsibility boundaries — pluggable backends (session 2026-04-01)

Owner question: if event logs move to a database at Tier 2, does that break
aibox's design? Resolution: aibox defines interfaces, backends are pluggable.

**aibox's responsibility:** Define schemas, provide git-based defaults, define
the interface that alternative backends must implement, provide skills that
work against the interface (not the backend).

**Derived project's responsibility:** Choose which backends to use, configure
infrastructure. A skill says `aibox event create ...` and aibox routes to the
configured backend.

```toml
# aibox.toml
[events]
backend = "git"                     # default: JSONL in git
# backend = "redis"                 # scaled: Redis Streams
# backend = "postgres"              # alternative

[search]
backend = "sqlite"                  # default: local SQLite FTS
# backend = "meilisearch"           # scaled

[identity]
backend = "local"                   # default: auto-generated cert
# backend = "ca"                    # team: project CA
# backend = "oidc"                  # enterprise: SSO
```

**Critical property:** Skills don't change between tiers. A skill says "log
this event" — whether it lands in JSONL or Redis is a deployment concern, not
a process concern. This means process definitions remain portable across all
tiers.

### 2.54 CLI tool count — one binary (session 2026-04-01)

The aiadm/aictl split was modeled on kubeadm/kubectl, but the Kubernetes split
exists because the admin and the user are typically different people on
different machines. In aibox Tier 0-1, they're the same person on the same
machine.

**Resolution:** One CLI binary (`aibox`) with subcommand grouping. No rename.

```
aibox init             ← project scaffolding
aibox admin cert       ← certificate management (was aiadm cert)
aibox admin image      ← container management (was aiadm image)
aibox create           ← CRUD operations (was aictl create)
aibox transition       ← state machine (was aictl transition)
aibox auth             ← identity/RBAC (was aictl auth)
aibox events           ← event queries
aibox lint             ← validation
aibox config           ← backend configuration
```

If enterprise needs warrant it later, `aibox admin` can be extracted into a
separate binary — but that's a packaging decision, not an architectural one.

**Impact on aiadm/aictl research:** The command mapping (§2.50 research section
2) remains valid — the commands are the same, just grouped under one binary
instead of two. The 40 aictl commands become `aibox <command>`, the aiadm
commands become `aibox admin <command>`.

### 2.55 kaits relationship clarified (session 2026-04-01)

kaits enters at Tier 3 as:

- **Multi-project orchestrator** (backend): manages governance across repos,
  provisions shared infrastructure (event store, search, CA), schedules agents
  across projects
- **Dashboard** (frontend): visualizes processes, events, metrics across
  projects. Could also serve as a GUI for process configuration ("this is how
  logging is done" = defining the event backend, configuring the MCP server)

kaits does not replace aibox — it's the layer above. Each project still has
aibox. kaits coordinates between them and provides the shared infrastructure
that individual projects connect to via pluggable backends (§2.53).

**Boundary clarification:**

| Concern | aibox | kaits |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Single-project context management | Yes | No |
| Process definition authoring | Yes (markdown + signing) | GUI for viewing/editing |
| Event logging interface | Yes (defines schema + skill) | Provides scaled backend |
| Agent orchestration | No (single agent) | Yes (multi-agent scheduling) |
| Cross-project queries | No | Yes |
| Infrastructure provisioning | Container images only | Full stack (DB, search, CA) |

### 2.57 Process repo as aibox-managed project — two levels, not three (session 2026-04-04)

Owner explored the implications of splitting process definitions into a
separate repo at Tier 1+. Key insight: if the process repo is itself an
aibox-managed project, then there needs to be a way to define how processes
are changed — a "meta-process."

**The recursive submodule question:** If a meta-process repo is a submodule in
the process repo, and the process repo is a submodule in the product repo, do
submodules cascade? Answer: **yes**, `git clone --recurse-submodules`
recursively clones all levels. Each level pins a specific commit hash. But
multi-level submodules add real friction — every `git pull` potentially
requires updating two pins, and developers frequently forget
`--recurse-submodules`.

**Resolution: two levels, not three.** The meta-process collapses into the
process repo's own governance. The process repo is an aibox-managed project
with its own `context/`:

```
process-repo/                          ← aibox-managed project
  context/
    processes/
      how-we-change-processes.md       ← THIS is the "meta-process"
      release-process.md
      code-review-process.md
    roles/
      process-architect.md             ← can modify process definitions
      process-reviewer.md              ← can approve process changes
    items/                             ← tracks process change requests as
                                          work items
  aibox.toml

product-repo/                          ← aibox-managed project
  context/
    items/                             ← work items, decisions, etc.
  processes/ (submodule → process-repo)
  src/
  aibox.toml
```

The recursion terminates at authority, not at more rules. Like Kubernetes: you
can have RBAC rules governing who can create RBAC rules, but at the top the CA
key holder has unchecked power. That's the trust anchor — not rules all the way
down.

**Process repo event log can be purely probabilistic.** Because:
- Process changes are low-frequency (no push-frequency problem)
- Every change is a git commit (deterministic audit trail for free)
- Git commit records who, when, what changed
- Git signatures add authorization proof
- The event-log skill captures reasoning ("why did we change this?") —
  probabilistic layer
- The commit history captures facts ("what changed?") — deterministic layer

Together they satisfy audit requirements without external infrastructure.

### 2.58 Per-file authorization policy (session 2026-04-04)

Within the process repo, different files need different authorization levels.
The meta-process file (`how-we-change-processes.md`) needs stronger protection
than regular process definitions.

**Mechanism: signed authorization policy file** (like GitHub CODEOWNERS,
enforced by aibox).

```toml
# .aibox/authorization-policy.toml (signed by governance-board)

# Rules evaluated top-to-bottom, first match wins
[[rules]]
pattern = ".aibox/authorization-policy.toml"
required_role = "governance-board"
min_approvals = 2

[[rules]]
pattern = "context/processes/how-we-change-processes.md"
required_role = "governance-board"
min_approvals = 1

[[rules]]
pattern = "context/processes/*.md"
required_role = "process-architect"

[[rules]]
pattern = "context/roles/*.md"
required_role = "process-architect"

[[rules]]
pattern = "context/items/**"
required_role = "developer"
```

**Bootstrap protection:** Auth rules live in a separate signed policy file,
not in the files themselves. Otherwise someone could modify the auth level AND
the content in the same commit. The policy file's first rule protects itself
(requires governance-board).

**Three enforcement points, layered:**

| Point | Mechanism | Strength | When |
|-------|-----------|----------|------|
| 1. Local CLI | `aibox edit` checks policy before writing | Advisory (agent can bypass via direct edit) | Before write |
| 2. Git pre-receive hook | Server rejects pushes without matching signed cert | Mechanical (cannot bypass without server access) | Before push |
| 3. Post-facto audit | `aibox lint --audit` verifies all commits against policy | Detective (compliance reviews) | Anytime |

**The server-side hook is where real enforcement lives:**
```
Developer pushes commit modifying release-process.md
  → Hook reads .aibox/authorization-policy.toml
  → Finds rule: "context/processes/*.md" requires "process-architect"
  → Checks commit signature → extracts cert → extracts roles
  → Role includes "process-architect"? → ALLOW
  → Role is only "developer"? → REJECT
```

**Approval requirements** (`min_approvals`) cannot be enforced by git alone —
git has no concept of "this commit was approved by N people." Two options:

- **Git platform PR rules (practical):** Map `min_approvals` to required
  reviewers. GitHub/GitLab enforces this. aibox documents the requirement; the
  platform enforces it. `aibox lint --audit` verifies compliance after the
  fact.
- **Co-signed commits (portable):** Commit carries N signatures via git
  trailers. aibox's hook verifies all required signatures are present. More
  portable but awkward UX.

For practical purposes, teams will use PR-based approvals. The authorization
policy documents the requirement, the git platform enforces it,
`aibox lint --audit` verifies.

### 2.59 RoleBinding indirection — identity ≠ roles (session 2026-04-04)

Owner identified that embedding roles in certificates (Kubernetes-style `O=`
field) is too rigid. Adding/removing a role would require reissuing the
certificate. Kubernetes itself suffers from this — no certificate revocation
means old certs with old roles remain valid until expiry.

**Resolution: certificates carry identity only. Roles are bound via RoleBinding
entities.**

Certificate contains only identity:
```
Certificate:
  Subject: CN=alice                    ← identity only, no roles
  Issuer:  CN=aibox-project-ca
```

Role assignments are separate entities:
```yaml
# context/rolebindings/BIND-calm-fox.md
---
apiVersion: aibox/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  id: BIND-calm-fox
spec:
  actor: ACTOR-alice
  role: ROLE-process-architect
  scope: "*"
---
```

**Authorization flow:**
```
Commit signature
  → verify against CA → extract CN=alice
  → look up Actor by CN → ACTOR-alice
  → find all RoleBindings where actor = ACTOR-alice
  → collect roles: [developer, process-architect]
  → check against authorization policy for modified files
```

Adding a role = creating a RoleBinding file. Removing = deleting it. No
certificate reissue. Certificate is long-lived (identity stable); role
assignments are dynamic (permissions change frequently). RoleBinding files
themselves are protected by authorization-policy.toml (requires `role-admin`
or `governance-board` to modify).

**New primitive:** RoleBinding becomes the 18th primitive. It is a governance
entity (low-volume, Pattern A naming: `BIND-alice-process-architect.md`).

### 2.60 Verification manifests — provider-agnostic enforcement (session 2026-04-04)

Owner identified that server-side pre-receive hooks are not universally
available across git providers (GitHub Enterprise only, GitLab Premium+, etc.).
The enforcement mechanism must work with bare git.

**Resolution: signed verification manifests embedded in commits.**

Every commit created through `aibox commit` includes a verification manifest
entry:

```jsonl
# .aibox/verification-log.jsonl (append-only, in the commit)
{"commit":"def456","files":["context/processes/release-process.md"],"actor":"alice","fingerprint":"ABCD1234","roles_claimed":["process-architect"],"rolebindings":["BIND-calm-fox"],"policy_rule":"context/processes/*.md → process-architect","policy_hash":"sha256:abc...","timestamp":"2026-04-04T10:00:00Z","signature":"base64:..."}
```

Each entry is signed by the committer's key. The entry proves: "I, alice,
claim I hold these roles, and I'm modifying these files under this policy
rule."

**Verification happens on read, not on write:**

```
aibox lint --audit
  → For each commit in history:
    1. Read verification manifest entry
    2. Verify entry signature (was this written by the claimed actor?)
    3. Look up actor's RoleBindings AT THAT POINT IN TIME (git history)
    4. Check: did claimed roles match actual RoleBindings at that commit?
    5. Check: do claimed roles satisfy authorization policy for modified files?
    6. Flag any mismatches as violations
```

RoleBinding files are also in git, also signed. Verification can reconstruct
exact authorization state at any historical point. If alice claims
`process-architect` but the RoleBinding didn't exist at that commit, the audit
catches it.

**Enforcement spectrum (weakest to strongest):**

| Layer | Mechanism | Bypass risk | Provider requirement |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Client pre-commit hook | Local check, skippable with `--no-verify` | High | None (git standard) |
| Verification manifest | Tamper-evident, signed, in commit | Medium (delayed detection) | None (git standard) |
| CI audit pipeline | `aibox lint --audit` in CI, blocks merge | Low | CI + branch protection |
| External audit from governance repo | Audit runs from trusted repo developer can't modify | Very low | CI + separate repo |
| Server pre-receive hook | Rejects push mechanically | Very low | Enterprise git tier |

Every team gets layers 1-3 regardless of provider. Layers 4-5 are available
for higher-security environments.

### 2.61 CI pipeline protection — governance repo as trust anchor (session 2026-04-04)

Owner identified that if the CI pipeline definition lives in the product repo,
a developer can modify the audit pipeline to be a no-op, then commit
unauthorized changes. The tampered CI "passes," branch protection is satisfied.

**Fundamental principle: there must be at least one enforcement point outside
the developer's control.** This is not an aibox limitation — it's a universal
security principle. Even Kubernetes depends on the API server binary being
something the user can't rewrite at runtime.

**Resolution: the governance repo is the external trust anchor.**

The audit pipeline runs from the governance repo, not the product repo. The
developer cannot modify it because they have no push access to the governance
repo.

```yaml
# governance-repo/.github/workflows/audit-product-repos.yml
# Triggered by product repo push events (webhook)
audit:
  steps:
    - checkout: governance-repo        # trusted policy source
    - checkout: product-repo           # untrusted, being audited
    - run: aibox lint --audit
           --policy governance-repo/.aibox/authorization-policy.toml
           --rolebindings governance-repo/context/rolebindings/
           --repo product-repo/
```

**Platform-specific alternatives:**
- GitHub: "Required workflows" at org level (defined in separate repo,
  developer can't skip)
- GitLab: "Compliance pipelines" (org-level, injected into all project
  pipelines)
- Self-hosted: Webhook triggers audit in governance repo CI

**The minimal trust anchors for the entire system:**

| Trust anchor | What it provides | Who controls it |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Governance repo | Authorization policy, RoleBindings, audit pipeline | Governance board (not developers) |
| Git platform settings | Branch protection, required status checks | Platform admin |
| aibox binary | Signature verification, manifest creation | Distributed/compiled |

Everything else is derived from these three. The product repo, including its
CI files, is explicitly untrusted.

**Even if ALL real-time enforcement is bypassed:** The verification manifests
in git history create a permanent, immutable evidence trail. A developer can
bypass CI but cannot erase the evidence from git's DAG (force-push is
prevented by branch protection). Any later audit — quarterly compliance review,
team lead spot-check, incident investigation — will catch violations.

### 2.62 Three-repo trust architecture — pure git enforcement (session 2026-04-04)

Owner proposed the definitive architecture: three repos mapping to three trust
levels, with git push permissions as the enforcement mechanism. This eliminates
the need for custom server-side hooks, enterprise-tier features, or
CI-dependent enforcement.

**Structure:**

```
meta-process-repo/              ← PUSH: governance board only
  processes/                    ← how processes are changed
  roles/                        ← role definitions
  rolebindings/                 ← role assignments
  authorization-policy.toml     ← governs process-repo

process-repo/                   ← PUSH: process architects only
  meta/ (submodule → meta-process-repo @ pinned commit)
  processes/                    ← "code" = process definitions for product
  roles/
  rolebindings/
  authorization-policy.toml     ← governs product repos

product-repo/                   ← PUSH: developers
  processes/ (submodule → process-repo @ pinned commit)
  context/                      ← governed artifacts (items, decisions, events)
  src/                          ← actual source code
```

All three repos are aibox-managed. Each repo's "code" is what it governs:
- Meta-process repo's "code" = meta-process definitions (how processes are
  changed)
- Process repo's "code" = process definitions (how products are built)
- Product repo's code = actual source code

Each repo's "context" comes from the repo above it via submodule.

**Why this works:** The fundamental problem — enforcement rules and governed
content in the same repo — is eliminated by construction. Process definitions
live in a repo the developer physically cannot push to. There's nothing to work
around.

**Enforcement uses only universal git platform features:**

| Feature | Purpose | Platform support |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Push permissions per repo | Trust domain separation | All platforms, all tiers |
| Signed commits required | Authorship proof | GitHub/GitLab/Gitea, free tier |
| Branch protection + PR reviews | Change approval | GitHub/GitLab/Gitea, free tier |
| CODEOWNERS | Protect `.gitmodules` from submodule URL tampering | GitHub/GitLab, free tier |
| Submodule commit pinning | Governance version control | Git standard |

No custom hooks. No enterprise tier. No CI dependency for enforcement.

**Submodule tampering defense:** A developer could modify `.gitmodules` to
point to a fork with relaxed process definitions. Three defenses:
1. CODEOWNERS marks `.gitmodules` as requiring process-architect approval
2. `aibox lint` verifies submodule URLs against canonical list in process-repo
   policy (which the developer can't modify — it's in the submodule)
3. The attack is inherently visible in diffs, PRs, and git log

**aibox commands become pure convenience, not enforcement:**

| Command | Purpose | Enforcement? |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `aibox init` | Scaffold with submodule | No (convenience) |
| `aibox commit` | Signed commit + verification manifest | No (convenience) |
| `aibox lint --audit` | Verify history against policy | No (detective) |
| `aibox edit` | Local RBAC check | No (advisory) |
| `aibox transition` | State change with manifest | No (convenience) |

Removing aibox doesn't remove the security properties — the repo separation
does.

**Horizontal scaling:** 50 product repos submodule the same process repo.
Updating a company-wide process = push to process repo + each product repo
updates its submodule pin (automatable via bot PR).

**Recursive audit:** `aibox lint --audit` walks the entire submodule chain:
verifies product repo against process-repo policy, process-repo against
meta-process-repo policy.

**Trust anchor termination:** The meta-process repo has no submodule above it.
It self-governs via push permissions (governance board only). This is the trust
anchor — authority, not more rules. Like Kubernetes CA key holder.

**Revised trust model (supersedes §2.61):**

| Trust anchor | What it provides | Universal? |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Repo push permissions | Trust domain separation | Yes — all git platforms |
| Branch protection | Require signed commits + PR approval | Yes — all major platforms, free tier |
| CODEOWNERS | Protect .gitmodules | Yes — GitHub/GitLab free tier |
| aibox binary | Convenience + audit verification | Yes — distributed, compiled |

No platform-specific dependencies (enterprise hooks, compliance pipelines)
required. These become optional hardening layers for organizations that have
them.

**Q-A (Scope of governance):** Entity files with frontmatter go through aibox
RBAC. Narrative content (research, work instructions) can be directly edited —
they're authored content, not process state. The boundary: does this file
represent a state machine entity? If yes, aibox governs it. If no, it's
unrestricted.

**Q-B (Guard evaluation):** Option (a) — trust the agent's assertion. Guards
are the probabilistic layer. The deterministic layer is: "did an authorized
actor invoke this transition through aibox?" not "are the guards actually
satisfied?"

**Q-C (Solo dev certificates):** Auto-generated self-signed cert at
`aibox init`. No CSR workflow, no CA management. The user never thinks about
certs — it's `git commit --gpg-sign` under the hood. `--no-auth` mode
available for truly zero-friction use.

**Q-D (Rename timing):** No rename. Keep `aibox` as the single binary.
Subcommand grouping (`aibox admin ...`) instead of binary splitting.
See §2.54.

**Q-E (Structured vs plain-English permissions):** Hybrid — structured rules
for enforcement + plain English as documentation. The structured rules are the
source of truth; the English is a human-readable gloss.

**Q-F (Daemon vs CLI-only):** CLI-only. Git is the persistence layer, each
invocation reads certs, validates, writes, exits. Overhead ~5-20ms per command
(negligible vs LLM inference). Daemon is a kaits concern if needed at Tier 3.

### 2.63 Git-native authorization reality check (session 2026-04-04)

Owner asked whether git natively supports certificate-attribute-based
authorization (reading CN/O from signed commits for role-based access control,
Kubernetes-style).

**Answer: No.** Git's native access control is strictly user/team-based. No
git platform reads certificate CN/O fields for authorization decisions.

**What git platforms actually enforce:**

| Mechanism | Based on | Reads cert CN/O? |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| SSH key authentication | SSH key → platform user account | No |
| Push permissions | Platform username / team | No |
| Branch protection | Platform username / team | No |
| CODEOWNERS | Platform username / team | No |
| Required signed commits | Valid signature exists (yes/no) | No — checks validity, ignores content |

**Consequence: two parallel identity systems exist:**

```
Git platform world:              aibox world:
  GitHub user "alice123"           Certificate CN=alice
  Team "process-architects"        RoleBinding ACTOR-alice → ROLE-process-architect
  Repo permission: write           authorization-policy.toml rules
```

The platform doesn't know about aibox roles. aibox doesn't control platform
permissions.

**Resolution: platform teams ARE the enforcement; aibox RoleBindings are the
audit layer.**

The three-repo architecture works because repo-level push permissions (platform
teams) align with trust levels. The mapping:

```
meta-process-repo  → GitHub/GitLab team "governance-board"    → push access
process-repo       → GitHub/GitLab team "process-architects"  → push access
product-repo       → GitHub/GitLab team "developers"          → push access
```

Platform team membership IS the role binding in practice for repo-level
enforcement.

**Bridging the two systems:**

RoleBinding entities document the platform mapping:
```yaml
# context/rolebindings/BIND-alice-process-architect.md
spec:
  actor: ACTOR-alice
  role: ROLE-process-architect
  platform_mapping:
    github_team: "process-architects"
    gitlab_group: "process-architects"
```

`aibox lint --audit` verifies alignment: "BIND-alice-process-architect exists,
but alice is not in GitHub team process-architects → WARNING: platform
enforcement not in sync."

An admin skill or script can sync: when a RoleBinding is created, it invites
the user to the corresponding platform team (or documents that this must be
done manually).

**Where each system enforces:**

| Scope | Enforcement | Mechanism |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Who can push to which repo | **Real** (server-side) | Platform teams (synced with aibox roles) |
| Who must approve PRs for which files | **Real** (server-side) | CODEOWNERS + platform teams |
| Which role can modify which files within a repo | **Advisory + audit** (aibox) | RoleBindings + verification manifests + lint --audit |
| Signed commits prove authorship | **Real** (cryptographic) | Git standard |
| Signed commits enforce role-based access | **Not a git feature** | aibox advisory layer only |

**Why this is actually fine for the three-repo architecture:**

- Repo boundary = trust level boundary → platform enforced (real)
- Within product repo = all developers have same trust level (same push access)
- Within process repo = all process architects have same trust level
- Fine-grained within-repo RBAC (process-architect-A can modify release.md but
  not code-review.md) = aibox advisory + audit. This is a rare scenario and
  acceptable as a non-mechanically-enforced policy.

**Self-hosted option for full cert-based auth:** Organizations running their
own git server (Gitea, Forgejo) can configure SSH certificate authentication
with custom extensions containing role claims. This enables true cert-based
push authorization but breaks "any git platform" universality. Documented as
an optional hardening path, not a requirement.

## 3. Current State (as of 2026-04-01)

### 3.1 Where we are

DISC-001 has progressed through three major phases:

**Phase 1 (§2.1–§2.49): Context system design.** Complete. 17 primitives
identified and mapped to storage. File-per-entity markdown+frontmatter as
source of truth, SQLite as derived index. Word-based IDs via petname.
Kubernetes-inspired object model (apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec). 17 skills
mapped to 17 primitives. 7 process packages defined. 6 personas validated
across 10 scenarios. 50 tentative decisions recorded.

**Phase 2 (§2.50): aiadm/aictl proposal.** Research complete, owner reviewed.
The purely probabilistic RBAC model (Decision 19) was identified as
insufficient for enterprise users who need deterministic enforcement and
tamper-proof audit logs. Research covered OS-level lockdown mechanisms,
kubectl-to-aictl command mapping, impact on all 50 decisions, and Kubernetes
certificate/RBAC mechanics. Key finding: architecturally sound, probabilistic
paradigm survives as a layer on a deterministic base.

**Phase 3 (§2.51–§2.63): Authorization design + scaling architecture.**
Complete. Owner reviewed the aiadm/aictl proposal and resolved all 6 open
questions. Then explored process repo architecture and per-file authorization
enforcement. Key outcomes:

- **Process protection via signed definitions + hash pinning** (§2.51):
  Process files remain in git but are verified against signed pins before
  execution. Tampering is detectable and rejectable, without filesystem
  lockdown.
- **Tiered scaling architecture** (§2.52): Four tiers from solo (all-git) to
  enterprise (pluggable backends). Event logs leave git at Tier 2 — the
  principle is "auditable and recoverable," not "everything in git."
- **Pluggable backends** (§2.53): aibox defines interfaces (event, search,
  identity). Git-based defaults, alternative backends configurable in
  aibox.toml. Skills are backend-agnostic.
- **One CLI binary** (§2.54): No aiadm/aictl split. `aibox` with subcommand
  grouping. `aibox admin` for infrastructure commands.
- **kaits as Tier 3 layer** (§2.55): Multi-project orchestrator + dashboard
  above aibox. Provides shared infrastructure (event store, search, CA) that
  aibox projects connect to.
- **Two-level repo architecture** (§2.57): Process repo is an aibox-managed
  project with its own governance. No meta-process repo needed — meta-process
  is a file in the process repo with higher authorization requirements.
- **Per-file authorization policy** (§2.58): Signed
  `.aibox/authorization-policy.toml` maps file patterns to required roles and
  approval counts. Enforced at three layers: local CLI (advisory), git
  pre-receive hooks (mechanical), post-facto audit (detective).
- **RoleBinding indirection** (§2.59): Certificates carry identity only, not
  roles. Roles assigned via RoleBinding entities. No certificate reissue on
  role changes. RoleBinding is the 18th primitive.
- **Verification manifests** (§2.60): Every commit carries a signed
  verification log entry proving authorization. Enforcement is
  provider-agnostic — verification happens on read (audit), not on write
  (push). Works with bare git.
- **Governance repo as trust anchor** (§2.61): Audit pipeline runs from
  governance repo, not product repo. Developer cannot tamper with enforcement
  because they can't push to governance repo. Three minimal trust anchors:
  governance repo, platform settings, aibox binary.
- **Three-repo trust architecture** (§2.62): Definitive enforcement model.
  Three repos (meta-process, process, product) map to three trust levels.
  Enforcement via repo push permissions — universal across all git platforms,
  no enterprise features needed. aibox commands become convenience, not
  enforcement. Repo separation IS the security.
- **Git-native authorization reality check** (§2.63): Git has no cert-based
  RBAC. Platform teams are the enforcement; aibox RoleBindings are the
  audit/advisory layer. Two parallel systems bridged via `platform_mapping`
  field and `aibox lint --audit` alignment checks. Within-repo RBAC is
  advisory, acceptable because repo separation aligns actors to trust levels.

### 3.2 Open questions — aiadm/aictl proposal (resolved 2026-04-01)

All 6 questions resolved by owner in §2.56. Summary:

- ~~**Q-A (Scope):** Entity files with frontmatter = governed. Narrative
  content = unrestricted.~~
- ~~**Q-B (Guards):** Option (a) — trust agent assertion. Guards are
  probabilistic layer.~~
- ~~**Q-C (Solo certs):** Auto-generated self-signed cert at init. `--no-auth`
  available.~~
- ~~**Q-D (Rename):** No rename. One binary `aibox` with subcommand
  grouping.~~
- ~~**Q-E (Permissions):** Hybrid — structured rules for enforcement + plain
  English as docs.~~
- ~~**Q-F (Daemon):** CLI-only. Daemon is a kaits/Tier 3 concern.~~

### 3.3 Open questions — earlier (still open)

3. **Directory structure**: Design the new `context/` layout with sharding.
   (Partially addressed in mapping exercise, needs finalization.)
4. **Migration plan**: Concrete steps to migrate from current format to
   file-per-entity. All IDs migrate, all files restructure. Need a migration
   script/command.
8. **Git repo as a primitive**: Owner noted that taking a git repository as
   granted is itself a precondition/primitive. Accepted for now to keep things
   simple.
10. **Archive indexing depth**: How deep does the SQLite index go into archived
    content? Metadata always indexed, full payload requires extraction. Need
    to define the boundary.
11. **INDEX.md generation**: What exactly goes into auto-generated directory
    index files? How does human override work? When does `aibox sync`
    regenerate them?

### 3.4 Resolved questions (for reference)

- ~~**Scaling**: resolved — see §2.7~~
- ~~**Primitive mapping**: resolved — see §2.10~~
- ~~**Event log**: resolved — JSONL, see §2.11 Q3~~
- ~~**Narrative vs structured**: resolved — content-primary vs
  metadata-primary, see §2.11 Q4~~
- ~~**Process templates**: resolved — packages are primitive activation tiers.
  See §2.38~~
- ~~**Wordlist curation**: resolved — petname crate, 3-8 char words, ~20M
  combos. See §2.21~~

## 4. Decisions Made (tentative, pending formal decision records)

1. **Storage**: Markdown+frontmatter as single source of truth. SQLite as
   derived runtime index (gitignored). No dual-master.
2. **Scaling**: Three-tier hot/warm/cold. Directory sharding. Sparse checkout
   for large repos.
3. **kaits boundary**: Repo-per-project. aibox handles per-project context
   (up to 100K items). kaits orchestrates across repos with its own database.
4. **IDs**: 2-word IDs from `petname` crate with custom wordlist (3-8 char
   words). Format: `BACK-swift-oak`. ~20M combinations per prefix type (no
   hex suffix needed). Full migration from sequential IDs. No content slugs
   in filenames.
5. **Discussions**: Are a primitive. Stored in `context/discussions/`.
6. **Actor primitive**: 17th primitive added. Describes people/agents
   (preferences, expertise, working style). Distinct from Role
   (responsibilities, permissions). OWNER.md/TEAM.md content migrates to
   Actor entities. OWNER.md and TEAM.md are retired — no legacy files, full
   migration.
7. **Kubernetes-inspired object model**: All entity frontmatter uses
   `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`/`spec` structure. Enables schema
   versioning, migration, and declarative reconciliation.
8. **Events**: JSONL files, monthly sharded by default, configurable. Index
   retains metadata permanently; payload requires extraction from archives.
9. **State machine guards**: Plain English, not minijinja. Agents evaluate
   probabilistically. Shell commands are suggestions (`on_transition.suggest`),
   not guaranteed. No `aibox transition` command — agents edit state directly,
   `aibox lint` validates after the fact.
10. **Sharding**: Configurable per entity type (none/yearly/monthly/weekly/
    daily). Non-destructive strategy changes.
11. **Three-level rule**: All entity .md files follow Level 1 (intro) →
    Level 2 (overview) → Level 3 (details). Directory INDEX.md files provide
    Level 0.
12. **Filename conventions**: Inverse date prefix for temporal files + content
    slug for human browsing. Word-IDs serve as natural content hints.
13. **No override mechanism**: Derived project owns its files after scaffolding.
    Direct editing by agents. Schema updates via `aibox migrate` producing
    diffs + migration prompts.
14. **Content-primary artifacts**: Research, work instructions, PRD stay in
    semantic directories with added frontmatter. Only metadata-primary
    artifacts go to items/artifact/.
15. **Multi-actor roles**: A role can be filled by multiple actors
    simultaneously. No forced sub-division. `filled_by:` is an array.
16. **aibox is infrastructure, not application**: aibox inits, syncs, lints,
    migrates. It does NOT enforce process logic (guards, transitions, hooks).
    Agents have full autonomy.
17. **Word-IDs without content slugs for entities**: `BACK-swift-oak.md` for
    work items. Content-primary files (research, decisions) MAY keep slugs:
    `20260327-ART-swift-oak-process-ontology.md`.
18. **Minijinja stays for infrastructure** (Dockerfile/compose rendering), NOT
    for process logic. Guard expressions and process guidance written in plain
    English for agents.
19. **RBAC via plain English**: Role permissions/restrictions written as
    natural language in Role definitions. Agents interpret probabilistically.
    `aibox lint` flags anomalies. aibox assumes zero liability.
20. **Dual event sources**: Process events logged by agent via event-log skill
    (probabilistic). Infrastructure events logged by aibox sync/lint
    (deterministic). Both in same JSONL files.
21. **No hook execution infrastructure**: Agents ARE the execution layer.
    Process suggestions are guidance; agents use their own tool access to act
    on them.
22. **Event-log skill**: aibox ships a skill that agents use to append process
    events. Simple JSONL append. Instruction to use it is prominent in
    scaffolded process documentation.
23. **Skills as agent API**: Every primitive gets a corresponding skill. 17
    skills mapped. Skills encode mechanical correctness; agents provide
    judgment. Cross-cutting concerns (RBAC, event logging, INDEX.md) embedded
    in each entity-modifying skill.
24. **Revised skill packages**: core/tracking/processes/planning/governance/
    collaboration/artifacts. Four presets: minimal, managed, software,
    full-product.
25. **Skill naming**: Long descriptive names (`workitem-management`,
    `decision-record-management`). Pattern: `<noun>-management` for CRUD,
    `<noun>-<verb>` for actions.
26. **Skill hierarchy**: Skills reference lower-layer skills by name in their
    instructions. `uses:` field in frontmatter documents dependencies.
    Strictly downward.
27. **Skill size**: One skill per primitive, ~100-200 lines. Split only above
    ~250 lines.
28. **Template originals**: `aibox init` stores originals in
    `context/.aibox/templates/`. Each `aibox update` adds new version.
    `aibox migrate` generates diffs + migration prompts. Derived project
    customization via direct editing — originals available for comparison.
29. **Three layers of process**: Primitive mechanics (aibox, always),
    micro-processes (aibox, optional), macro-frameworks (kaits/community).
    aibox does NOT ship SAFe, Scrum, etc. Optional community framework
    packages via `aibox process install`.
30. **Process packages = primitive activation tiers**: minimal/managed/
    software/research/full-product activate progressively more primitives.
    They are NOT framework choices.
31. **Personas and user stories**: Fit existing primitives. Persona = Actor
    (subtype: persona). User story = Work Item (subtype: story). No new
    primitives needed.
32. **Revised core packages**: minimal, managed, software, research (expanded),
    editorial (new), consulting (new), full-product. Seven packages total.
33. **Community process packages**: Git repos with package.yaml + context/ +
    skills/. Installed via `aibox process install <url>`. Validated via
    `aibox process check`.
34. **6 personas defined**: Alex (solo dev), Priya (scientist), Maria (team
    lead), Sam (consultant), kaits (orchestrator), Jordan (content producer).
35. **Hybrid audit model**: Three logging channels — provider hooks
    (deterministic, what), agent event-log (probabilistic, why), aibox sync
    (deterministic, infrastructure). Optional `[audit]` section in aibox.toml.
36. **No new primitives for software**: 17 primitives cover full software
    lifecycle through composition. Environments, feature flags, dependencies
    modeled as subtypes.
37. **4 additional process templates**: incident-response, technical-design,
    spike-research, hotfix. Must-have for software package v1.
38. **10 scenarios validated**: All walked through in detail. 14 issues found
    and resolved. Full walkthroughs in DISC-001 personas appendix.
39. **Naming standardized**: Gate (not Checkpoint), Scope (not Project)
    everywhere. Primitives get top-level dirs under context/ (not nested under
    items/).
40. **Two filename patterns**: Human-named (Pattern A) for low-volume entities,
    word-id + content-slug (Pattern B) for high-volume. Human readability
    preserved.
41. **INDEX.md is structural only**: Purpose, schema, subtypes, skills. NO
    statistics, counts, or state groupings. Those come from SQLite index.
42. **SQLite index from init**: Created by `aibox init`, not deferred. Queries
    work from first session.
43. **Human identity via ~/.aibox/identity.toml**: Kubernetes kubeconfig
    pattern. Local file never committed. `aibox auth whoami` command. Cascade:
    identity.toml → env var → provider → git config → ask. Actor files
    non-sensitive; personal prefs in identity.toml.
44. **Open threads as sub-work-items**: Significant threads become child work
    items. Small threads noted in parent's Open Questions section.
45. **Provider-native scheduling opt-in**: Optional [scheduling] in aibox.toml.
    Session-start check is always the fallback. Provider scheduling is a bonus.
46. **kaits agents use skills**: kaits orchestrates agents, agents use aibox
    skills. Same skills as human agents — no separate kaits-specific file
    writing.
47. **Identity model: 3 layers**: (1) ~/.aibox/identity.toml (local, never
    committed), (2) Actor registry in context/actor/ (shared, non-sensitive),
    (3) Role definitions in context/role/ (shared, permissions/restrictions in
    plain English).
48. **RBAC flow**: identity.toml → match to Actor via handle/email → read
    Actor's roles → load Role permissions/restrictions → check on every
    modifying action. Additive model: any role granting permission wins. Event
    log provides attribution/audit.
49. **Actor types**: human (identity.toml), ai-agent (env var or
    kaits-assigned), service (CI/CD via env var). All types follow same RBAC
    model.
50. **`aibox auth whoami`**: Displays resolved identity, matched Actor, roles,
    permissions, restrictions, active provider. Inspired by kubectl auth
    whoami.

**NOTE:** Decisions 9, 19, 20, 21, 35, 43, 47, 48 are **superseded** by the
aiadm/aictl proposal (§2.50) and the authorization design session
(§2.51–§2.56). They remain listed here for historical context. The Phase 3
resolutions below replace them.

**Phase 3 decisions (2026-04-01):**

51. **Signed process definitions**: Process files remain markdown in git but
    are signed by process-admin cert and hash-pinned in
    `.aibox/process-pins.toml`. aibox verifies hash before trusting process
    definitions. Tampering is detectable without filesystem lockdown.
    Supersedes the OS-level lockdown approach from §2.50.
52. **Governance vs governed separation**: Low-volume entities (Process, Role,
    Gate, Constraint, Scope) are governance — require process-admin signature.
    High-volume entities (WorkItem, Decision, Discussion, Artifact) are
    governed — normal RBAC. Aligns with Decision 40 (two filename patterns).
53. **Principle: auditable and recoverable, not everything-in-git**: Git is
    the zero-infrastructure default. The actual principle is auditability
    (attributable, immutable, queryable, recoverable, portable). Alternative
    backends that satisfy these properties are valid at scale.
54. **Tiered scaling**: Four tiers (Solo → Small team → Medium team →
    Enterprise). Events leave git at Tier 2. Governance and artifacts stay in
    git at all tiers. See §2.52 for full tier table.
55. **Pluggable backends**: aibox defines interfaces for events, search, and
    identity. Git-based defaults. Alternative backends (Redis, Postgres,
    Meilisearch, OIDC) configurable in aibox.toml. Skills are
    backend-agnostic.
56. **One CLI binary**: No aiadm/aictl split. `aibox` with subcommand
    grouping. Infrastructure commands under `aibox admin`. The 40 aictl
    commands become `aibox <command>`, the aiadm commands become
    `aibox admin <command>`.
57. **kaits is Tier 3**: Multi-project orchestrator + dashboard. Sits above
    aibox. Provides shared infrastructure (event store, search, CA). Each
    project still uses aibox. kaits coordinates between them.
58. **RBAC permissions: structured + documented**: Role definitions use
    structured verb+kind rules for mechanical enforcement, with plain English
    `description` fields as human-readable documentation. Supersedes
    Decision 19.
59. **Guards: trust agent assertion**: aibox records the transition with a
    note that guards were self-attested. Guard text logged for audit but not
    mechanically evaluated. Supersedes Decision 9.
60. **Event log append-only in git**: Per-actor JSONL sharding (each actor
    appends to own file). Server-side pre-receive hooks enforce append-only.
    Works at Tiers 0-1. At Tier 2+, events move to configured backend.
    Supersedes Decision 20.
61. **Two-level repo architecture**: Process repo is an aibox-managed project
    (self-governing). No separate meta-process repo — the meta-process is a
    file in the process repo with higher authorization requirements. Submodules
    cascade recursively but three levels adds friction without proportional
    benefit. Recursion terminates at authority (trust anchor), not at more
    rules.
62. **Per-file authorization policy**: `.aibox/authorization-policy.toml` maps
    file glob patterns to required roles and minimum approval counts. Policy
    file is signed by governance-board role. First rule protects the policy
    file itself (bootstrap protection). Enforcement: local CLI (advisory) + git
    pre-receive hooks (mechanical) + post-facto audit (detective). Approval
    counts enforced via git platform PR rules or co-signed commits.
63. **Process repo event log is probabilistic**: Low-frequency changes mean no
    git scaling problem. Git commit history IS the deterministic audit trail.
    Event-log skill captures reasoning (probabilistic). No external event
    infrastructure needed for governance repos.
64. **RoleBinding as 18th primitive**: Certificates carry identity only
    (CN=username), not roles. Roles bound via RoleBinding entities (actor +
    role + scope). Adding/removing roles requires no certificate reissue.
    RoleBinding files are governance entities (low-volume, Pattern A naming).
    Protected by authorization-policy.toml.
65. **Verification manifests in commits**: Every `aibox commit` appends a
    signed entry to `.aibox/verification-log.jsonl` recording: files changed,
    actor, roles claimed, policy rule matched. Verification happens on read
    (`aibox lint --audit`), not on write. Provider-agnostic — works with bare
    git, no server-side hook required.
66. **Governance repo as external trust anchor**: The audit pipeline runs from
    the governance repo, which the developer cannot push to. This is the
    minimal external dependency for enforcement. Three trust anchors: governance
    repo, git platform settings, aibox binary. Product repo (including its CI
    files) is explicitly untrusted.
67. **Enforcement is layered, not single-point**: Five layers from weakest to
    strongest: client hook (advisory) → verification manifest (tamper-evident)
    → CI audit (blocks merge) → external audit from governance repo
    (tamper-proof) → server pre-receive hook (mechanical). Every team gets
    layers 1-3. Layers 4-5 for higher security.
68. **Three-repo trust architecture**: Three repos = three trust levels.
    Meta-process repo (governance board push), process repo (process architect
    push), product repo (developer push). Enforcement via repo push permissions
    — universal, no custom hooks. Submodule pins version governance. Each repo
    is aibox-managed. Supersedes single-repo models. This is the definitive
    enterprise architecture.
69. **aibox commands are convenience, not enforcement**: Repo separation
    provides security. aibox provides pleasant UX (scaffolding, signed commits,
    verification manifests, recursive audit) but removing aibox doesn't remove
    the security properties.
70. **Submodule tampering defense**: CODEOWNERS on `.gitmodules` (requires
    process-architect approval) + `aibox lint` verifies canonical URLs from
    submodule policy + inherent visibility of `.gitmodules` changes in
    diffs/PRs.
71. **Trust anchor termination**: Meta-process repo has no submodule above it.
    Self-governs via push permissions (governance board only). The recursion
    terminates at authority. Confirms §2.57 decision: two levels of submodules
    is the maximum needed.
72. **Git has no native RBAC**: No git platform reads certificate CN/O for
    authorization. Push permissions are user/team-based only. Signed commit
    verification checks validity, not identity attributes. This is a
    fundamental platform limitation, not solvable by aibox.
73. **Platform teams = enforcement, aibox RoleBindings = audit**: Repo-level
    push permissions (via platform team membership) are the real enforcement
    mechanism. aibox RoleBindings document the intended role assignments,
    bridge to platform teams via `platform_mapping` field, and enable
    `aibox lint --audit` to verify alignment. Two parallel systems, kept in
    sync.
74. **Within-repo RBAC is advisory**: Fine-grained file-level authorization
    within a single repo (e.g., which process architect can modify which
    process file) is enforced by aibox verification manifests + lint --audit,
    not by git natively. This is acceptable because the three-repo architecture
    means within-repo actors share the same trust level.
