# Primitive Mapping Exercise: 16 Primitives to Storage

**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Purpose:** Map each of the 16 universal primitives to concrete file
locations, YAML schemas, state machines, and storage tier
classification.

---

## Design Decisions Applied

These mappings follow tentative decisions from early design:
- **Source of truth:** Markdown + YAML frontmatter (file-per-entity)
- **IDs:** Short UUID (8 hex chars), format `TYPE-xxxxxxxx`
- **Directory sharding:** `items/<type>/<YYYY>/<MM>/` for high-volume
  primitives
- **Storage tiers:** Hot (filesystem) / Warm (SQLite index, gitignored)
  / Cold (archive)
- **Narrative vs structured:** Frontmatter = structured fields; body =
  narrative content

## Notation

- **Required fields** are marked with `*`
- **`custom:`** is always available as a free-form YAML map for
  user-defined fields
- State machines use `-->` for transitions, `|` for branching
- File paths use `{id}` as placeholder for the entity's full ID

---

## 1. Work Item

**New location:** `context/items/work/{id}.md`
**Sharding:** `context/items/work/2026/03/{id}.md` (when >1K items)
**Hot/cold:** Hot while open; cold (archive) when done >90 days

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: BACK-a7f3b2c1        # * short UUID
type: work-item            # * primitive type (fixed)
subtype: task              # * task | bug | feature | epic | story | chore
title: "Implement X"      # * human-readable title
state: in-progress         # * see state machine below
priority: medium           # * critical | high | medium | low
owner: "@alice"            # role reference
parent: BACK-f290e4b3     # optional parent work item
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6      # scope/container reference
created_at: 2026-03-27    # * ISO date
updated_at: 2026-03-27    # * ISO date
due_date: 2026-04-15      # optional deadline
estimate: M                # optional size (XS/S/M/L/XL)
tags: [backend, auth]      # category references (non-exclusive)
refs:                      # typed cross-references
  - type: blocks
    target: BACK-b2c3d4e5
  - type: implements
    target: DEC-e4f5a6b7
custom: {}                 # user-defined fields
```

### State Machine

```
draft --> ready --> in-progress --> in-review --> done
                       |                          |
                       +--> blocked               |
                       +--> cancelled -------------+
```

States: `draft`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `in-review`, `blocked`,
`done`, `cancelled`
Terminal: `done`, `cancelled`
Initial: `draft`

### Markdown Body

Free-form description, acceptance criteria, notes, discussion.

---

## 2. Log Entry / Event

**New location:** `context/events/` as append-only JSONL
**File:** `context/events/{YYYY}-{MM}.jsonl` (one file per month)
**Hot/cold:** Current month = hot; older months = cold (compress to
.jsonl.gz)

### Schema (JSONL, not YAML frontmatter)

Events are high-volume, append-only, and primarily machine-consumed.
JSONL is more appropriate than individual .md files.

```jsonl
{"id":"EVT-a1b2c3d4","ts":"2026-03-27T14:30:00Z","type":"state-change","actor":"@alice","subject":"BACK-a7f3b2c1","data":{"field":"state","from":"ready","to":"in-progress"},"source":"cli"}
{"id":"EVT-b2c3d4e5","ts":"2026-03-27T15:00:00Z","type":"comment","actor":"@alice","subject":"BACK-a7f3b2c1","data":{"body":"Started implementation"},"source":"cli"}
```

### Event Types

- `state-change` -- field changed on any entity
- `comment` -- narrative note on any entity
- `creation` -- entity created
- `deletion` -- entity removed/archived
- `gate-result` -- checkpoint evaluated (pass/fail/waive)
- `metric-sample` -- measurement data point
- `system` -- automated events (sync, rebuild, etc.)

### State Machine

None -- events are immutable. They exist or they don't.

**Note:** This is the one primitive that does NOT use file-per-entity
markdown. The rationale: events are high-volume (potentially thousands
per day in active projects), append-only, and primarily
machine-consumed. JSONL gives efficient append + line-by-line parsing.
Monthly sharding keeps files manageable. The SQLite warm index provides
queryability.

---

## 3. Decision Record

**New location:** `context/items/decision/{id}.md`
**Sharding:** Unlikely to need it (decisions are low-volume)
**Hot/cold:** Hot while proposed/accepted; cold when
deprecated/superseded >180 days

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: DEC-f290e4b3          # * short UUID
type: decision-record      # * primitive type
title: "Use SQLite as derived index"  # * what was decided
state: accepted            # * proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded
date: 2026-03-27           # * when decided
decision_makers:           # * who decided
  - "@owner"
  - "@claude"
superseded_by: null        # DEC-xxx if replaced
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6       # optional scope
tags: [architecture, storage]
refs:
  - type: affects
    target: BACK-a7f3b2c1
  - type: justified-by
    target: DISC-001
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

```
proposed --> accepted --> deprecated
                |
                +--> superseded (by DEC-xxx)
```

States: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded`
Terminal: `deprecated`, `superseded`
Initial: `proposed`

### Markdown Body

Structured narrative sections:
- **Context** -- situation requiring a decision
- **Decision** -- what was decided and why
- **Alternatives** -- options considered and why rejected
- **Consequences** -- implications (positive, negative, risks)

---

## 4. Artifact

**New location:** `context/items/artifact/{id}.md` (metadata file
pointing to actual artifact)
**Hot/cold:** Follows the artifact it describes

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: ART-c3d4e5f6          # * short UUID
type: artifact             # * primitive type
title: "API specification v2"  # * human-readable name
subtype: document          # * document | code | build | report | design | dataset
state: published           # * draft | in-review | approved | published | archived | superseded
version: "2.1.0"          # semantic or sequential
author: "@alice"           # role reference
location: "docs/api-spec.yaml"  # * path or URI to actual artifact
format: "application/yaml" # media type
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
created_at: 2026-03-27
updated_at: 2026-03-27
tags: [api, documentation]
refs:
  - type: produced-by
    target: BACK-a7f3b2c1
  - type: approved-at
    target: GATE-d4e5f6a7
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

```
draft --> in-review --> approved --> published --> archived
              |                                     |
              +--> rejected (back to draft)          +--> superseded
```

States: `draft`, `in-review`, `approved`, `rejected`, `published`,
`archived`, `superseded`
Terminal: `archived`, `superseded`
Initial: `draft`

### Markdown Body

Description of the artifact, changelog, review notes.

**Design note:** Most context files (research reports, work
instructions) are BOTH artifacts and their own content. For these, the
frontmatter IS the artifact metadata -- no separate metadata file
needed. The separate `items/artifact/` entry is for tracking external
artifacts (builds, deployments, files outside context/).

---

## 5. Role

**New location:** `context/items/role/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Always hot (roles are reference data)

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: ROLE-d4e5f6a7         # * short UUID
type: role                 # * primitive type
name: "Product Owner"      # * role name
state: active              # * active | suspended | revoked
permissions:               # what this role can do
  - "approve-decisions"
  - "prioritize-backlog"
responsibilities:          # what this role must do
  - "Maintain product backlog"
  - "Define acceptance criteria"
filled_by:                 # current holders
  - "@alice"
reports_to: ROLE-e5f6a7b8 # hierarchical superior
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
tags: [leadership]
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

Role assignments (not roles themselves):
```
proposed --> active --> suspended --> revoked
```

States: `active`, `suspended`, `revoked`
Terminal: `revoked`
Initial: `active`

### Markdown Body

Detailed role description, expectations, authority boundaries.

---

## 6. Process / Workflow

**New location:** `context/items/process/{id}.md` (instance-specific)
+ `templates/processes/*.md` (definitions)
**Hot/cold:** Definitions always hot; instances follow work item
lifecycle

### YAML Frontmatter Schema (Process Definition)

```yaml
id: PROC-e5f6a7b8         # * short UUID
type: process              # * primitive type
name: "Code Review"        # * process name
version: "1.0.0"           # semantic version
state: active              # * draft | active | deprecated
trigger: "pull-request-created"  # what starts this process
inputs:                    # required artifacts
  - "source-code"
  - "test-results"
outputs:                   # produced artifacts
  - "review-comments"
  - "approval-decision"
roles:                     # participating roles
  - ROLE-d4e5f6a7          # author
  - ROLE-f6a7b8c9          # reviewer
gates:                     # quality checkpoints
  - GATE-a7b8c9d0
metrics:                   # how success is measured
  - MET-b8c9d0e1
owner: ROLE-d4e5f6a7
tags: [quality, development]
custom: {}
```

### State Machine (Process Instance)

```
not-started --> in-progress --> completed
                    |
                    +--> suspended
                    +--> aborted
                    +--> failed
```

States: `not-started`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `suspended`,
`aborted`, `failed`
Terminal: `completed`, `aborted`, `failed`
Initial: `not-started`

### Markdown Body

Step-by-step procedure, decision points, guidance notes.

---

## 7. State Machine

**New location:** `context/schemas/state-machines/{name}.yaml`
**Hot/cold:** Always hot (configuration data)

### Schema (Pure YAML, not markdown)

State machines are definitions, not narrative documents. Pure YAML is
appropriate.

```yaml
name: work-item-default        # * machine name
description: "Default work item lifecycle"
governs: work-item             # which primitive type(s)
initial: draft
terminal: [done, cancelled]
states:
  draft:
    description: "Created but not ready for work"
  ready:
    description: "Accepted and ready to be picked up"
  in-progress:
    description: "Actively being worked on"
  in-review:
    description: "Work complete, awaiting review"
  blocked:
    description: "Cannot proceed due to dependency"
  done:
    description: "Completed and accepted"
  cancelled:
    description: "Abandoned, will not be completed"
transitions:
  - from: draft
    to: ready
    trigger: accept
  - from: ready
    to: in-progress
    trigger: start
  - from: in-progress
    to: in-review
    trigger: submit
  - from: in-progress
    to: blocked
    trigger: block
  - from: blocked
    to: in-progress
    trigger: unblock
  - from: in-review
    to: done
    trigger: approve
  - from: in-review
    to: in-progress
    trigger: reject
  - from: [draft, ready, in-progress, blocked]
    to: cancelled
    trigger: cancel
```

### State Machine

Meta: state machines don't have their own state machine. They are
static definitions -- either active or not.

---

## 8. Category / Taxonomy

**New location:** `context/schemas/categories/{name}.yaml`
**Hot/cold:** Always hot (configuration data)

### Schema (Pure YAML)

```yaml
name: priority                 # * category dimension name
description: "How urgent/important a work item is"
exclusive: true                # only one value per entity
hierarchical: false            # flat list, not a tree
default: medium
values:
  - id: critical
    label: "Critical"
    description: "Drop everything"
    color: "#dc2626"
  - id: high
    label: "High"
    description: "Address this cycle"
    color: "#ea580c"
  - id: medium
    label: "Medium"
    description: "Normal priority"
    color: "#ca8a04"
  - id: low
    label: "Low"
    description: "When time permits"
    color: "#16a34a"
```

Additional default categories: `subtype`
(task/bug/feature/epic/story/chore), `size` (XS/S/M/L/XL), `area`
(user-defined).

### State Machine

None -- categories are static definitions.

---

## 9. Cross-Reference / Relation

**New location:** Stored inline in entity frontmatter `refs:` field +
materialized in SQLite index
**No dedicated file** -- cross-references live on the entities they
connect

### Schema (Inline in entity frontmatter)

```yaml
refs:
  - type: blocks           # * relationship type
    target: BACK-b2c3d4e5  # * target entity ID
  - type: implements
    target: DEC-e4f5a6b7
  - type: relates-to
    target: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
  - type: parent-child
    target: BACK-f290e4b3
```

### Allowed Relationship Types

- `parent-child` -- hierarchical containment
- `blocks` / `blocked-by` -- dependency (stored on blocker, inverse
  computed)
- `relates-to` -- informational association
- `duplicates` -- equivalence
- `supersedes` -- replacement
- `implements` -- realization
- `caused-by` -- causal
- `references` -- citation
- `produced-by` -- authorship/origin
- `approved-at` -- gate linkage
- `justified-by` -- decision evidence

### State Machine

None -- references are structural, not stateful. Created or deleted.

### Warm Index

The SQLite index maintains a bidirectional reference table for fast
lookups: `(source_id, relation_type, target_id)` with inverse
computation.

---

## 10. Checkpoint / Gate

**New location:** `context/items/gate/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Definitions always hot; evaluation results are events

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: GATE-a7b8c9d0         # * short UUID
type: checkpoint           # * primitive type
name: "PR Merge Readiness" # * gate name
state: active              # * active | inactive
severity: blocking         # * blocking | advisory
automated: true            # machine-checkable?
authority: ROLE-d4e5f6a7   # who can approve/waive
criteria:                  # * what must be true
  - id: tests-pass
    description: "All tests pass"
    automated: true
  - id: review-approved
    description: "At least one reviewer approved"
    automated: false
  - id: no-lint-warnings
    description: "Zero clippy warnings"
    automated: true
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
tags: [quality, ci]
refs:
  - type: enforces
    target: CON-c9d0e1f2   # constraint reference
custom: {}
```

### State Machine (Gate Evaluation)

Gate evaluations are recorded as events, not as states on the gate
definition. Each evaluation produces an event:

```jsonl
{"id":"EVT-xxx","type":"gate-result","subject":"GATE-a7b8c9d0","data":{"target":"BACK-a7f3b2c1","result":"passed","criteria":{"tests-pass":true,"review-approved":true,"no-lint-warnings":true}}}
```

The gate definition itself is either `active` or `inactive`.

### Markdown Body

Detailed criteria descriptions, examples, waiver policy.

---

## 11. Metric / Measure

**New location:** `context/items/metric/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Definitions always hot; values are events in the event
log

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: MET-b8c9d0e1          # * short UUID
type: metric               # * primitive type
name: "Lead Time"          # * metric name
description: "Time from ready to done"
unit: hours                # * unit of measurement
formula: "done_at - ready_at"  # how to compute
target: 48                 # desired value
thresholds:
  green: [0, 48]
  yellow: [48, 96]
  red: [96, null]
frequency: weekly          # how often computed
source_events:             # what events feed this
  - "state-change(to=done)"
  - "state-change(to=ready)"
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
tags: [flow, performance]
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

None for the definition. Metric health is a computed property:
- `within-target` (green) / `approaching-threshold` (yellow) /
  `breached` (red)

Computed by the materializer from event data; not stored as a field.

### Markdown Body

What this metric measures, why it matters, how to improve it.

---

## 12. Schedule / Cadence

**New location:** `context/items/schedule/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Always hot (active schedules)

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: SCHED-c9d0e1f2        # * short UUID
type: schedule             # * primitive type
name: "Weekly Review"      # * schedule name
subtype: cadence           # * cadence | deadline | window
state: active              # * active | paused | completed
pattern: "weekly(friday)"  # recurrence (or cron: "0 9 * * 5")
start_date: 2026-03-01
end_date: null             # null = indefinite
duration: 1h               # how long each occurrence
timezone: "Europe/Amsterdam"
triggers_process: PROC-e5f6a7b8  # what happens when it fires
owner: ROLE-d4e5f6a7
scope: PROJ-c3d4e5f6
tags: [ceremony, review]
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

```
planned --> active --> completed
               |
               +--> paused
```

States: `planned`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`
Terminal: `completed`
Initial: `planned`

### Markdown Body

Purpose of the cadence, agenda template, expected outcomes.

---

## 13. Scope / Container

**New location:** `context/items/scope/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Hot while active; cold when archived

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: PROJ-d0e1f2a3         # * short UUID (keep PROJ- prefix for project scopes)

constraints:               # active constraints in this scope
  - CON-c9d0e1f2
tags: [product, release]
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

```
planned --> active --> completed --> archived
               |
               +--> suspended
               +--> cancelled
```

States: `planned`, `active`, `completed`, `suspended`, `cancelled`,
`archived`
Terminal: `archived`, `cancelled`
Initial: `planned`

### Markdown Body

Scope description, goals, boundaries, success criteria.

---

## 14. Constraint

**New location:** `context/items/constraint/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Always hot while active

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: CON-e1f2a3b4          # * short UUID
type: constraint           # * primitive type
name: "WIP Limit"          # * constraint name

tags: [flow, kanban]
refs:
  - type: enforced-at
    target: GATE-a7b8c9d0
custom: {}
```

### State Machine

```

             |
             +--> suspended (temporary waiver)
```

States: `draft`, `active`, `suspended`, `superseded`
Terminal: `superseded`
Initial: `draft`

### Markdown Body

Full constraint description, rationale, exemption/waiver policy.

---

## 15. Context / Environment

**New location:** Stays as-is -- the `context/` directory IS this
primitive
**Hot/cold:** Always hot (it's the active working context)

### Design Note

Context/Environment is the **meta-primitive** -- it's the container
for all other primitives. The `context/` directory itself, plus
`AGENTS.md` at the repo root, IS the context. Individual context
artifacts (PRD, work instructions, research reports) are files that
carry their own frontmatter.

Rather than creating a separate entity type, Context is represented by:
1. **`processkit.toml`** -- project-level configuration (which process
   template, which packages enabled)
2. **`AGENTS.md`** -- agent-facing context instructions
3. **`context/`** -- the directory structure containing all primitives

### YAML Frontmatter (on context documents like PRD.md, work
instructions)

```yaml
type: context              # marks this as ambient context
subtype: requirements      # requirements | instructions | reference | research
title: "Product Requirements"
scope: PROJ-d0e1f2a3
updated_at: 2026-03-27
tags: [product]
```

### State Machine

None -- context documents are living documents, versioned by git.

---

## 16. Discussion

**New location:** `context/items/discussion/{id}.md`
**Hot/cold:** Hot while active; cold when concluded

### YAML Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
id: DISC-f2a3b4c5         # * short UUID (or sequential for rare human-authored ones)
type: discussion           # * primitive type
title: "Context System Redesign"  # * discussion topic
state: active              # * active | concluded | abandoned
date: 2026-03-27           # * when started
participants:              # * who is involved
  - "@owner"

## Summary: Three Storage Patterns

The 16 primitives map to exactly **three storage patterns**:

1. **File-per-entity markdown** (11 primitives): Work Item, Decision,
   Artifact, Role, Process, Gate, Metric, Schedule, Scope, Constraint,
   Discussion
   - YAML frontmatter + markdown body
   - Git-native diffs, blame, merge
   - SQLite warm index for queries

2. **JSONL append-only** (1 primitive): Log Entry / Event
   - High-volume, machine-consumed
   - Monthly sharding
   - Immutable records

3. **YAML configuration** (2 primitives): State Machine,
   Category/Taxonomy
   - Static definitions, rarely changed
   - Referenced by entities via name

Plus **2 structural primitives** with no dedicated storage:
- Cross-Reference -- inline `refs:` in entity frontmatter
- Context/Environment -- the directory structure itself

## Open Questions

1. **Migration of existing IDs:** Keep legacy IDs as-is and only use
   UUIDs for new items? Or migrate all at once?
2. **Event log format:** JSONL monthly files vs. SQLite-only (events
   are the one primitive where git-native may not matter since they're
   append-only)?
3. **Artifact self-description:** Research reports and work
   instructions are both artifacts AND their content. Do they get
   frontmatter added in-place, or do they get a separate metadata
   pointer in `items/artifact/`?
4. **Process definitions vs instances:** Process templates in
   `templates/processes/` are definitions. Running instances (e.g.,
   "code review for PR #42") -- do these get their own
   `items/process/` file, or are they tracked as work items with a
   `process:` reference?
5. **ID prefix consistency:** The table above uses BACK- for work
   items (legacy) but PROJ- for scopes. Should we standardize to
   WORK- or keep BACK- for familiarity?
