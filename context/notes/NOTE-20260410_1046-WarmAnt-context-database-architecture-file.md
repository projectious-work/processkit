# Context Database Architecture Research

**Status:** Research complete
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## 1. Problem Statement

processkit needs a storage layer for process primitives -- work items,
events, decisions, projects, metrics, cross-references, and
user-defined entities. This layer must satisfy five constraints
simultaneously:

1. **Single source of truth** -- one authoritative format, no
   dual-master synchronization
2. **Git-native** -- data lives in a git repo with meaningful diffs,
   merges, and code review
3. **Flexible schema** -- user-defined fields per artifact type (like
   Jira custom fields)
4. **Efficient search** -- structured queries and RAG (vector
   embeddings)
5. **Human-readable** -- developers can read/understand data without
   special tooling

This document evaluates storage architectures against these constraints
and recommends an approach.

## 2. Git and Binary Files -- The Real Story

### 2.1 How Git Stores Objects

Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem. Every file
version is stored as a **blob** object, identified by its SHA-1 hash.
When first written, blobs are stored as **loose objects** --
individually zlib-compressed files in `.git/objects/`.

As the repository grows, `git gc` (or `git repack`) consolidates
loose objects into **packfiles** (`.git/objects/pack/*.pack`).
Packfiles use **delta compression**: git finds similar objects, stores
one as a base, and the rest as binary deltas. The packing heuristic
sorts objects by type, then by filename, then by size -- so successive
versions of the same file tend to be packed as deltas against each
other.

### 2.2 Binary Files: Where Delta Compression Fails

Delta compression works on raw bytes, not semantic structure. For text
files (source code, JSON, markdown), consecutive versions share most
bytes, so deltas are tiny. For binary files, the story is different:

- **Structured binary formats** (SQLite, Protocol Buffers,
  MessagePack): even a single-field change can shift byte offsets
  throughout the file, causing the entire file to appear different.
  SQLite in particular reorders pages, updates header counters, and
  may rearrange B-tree nodes on any write.
- **Compressed formats** (JPEG, PNG, ZIP): compression destroys
  byte-level similarity. A one-pixel change in an image produces a
  completely different compressed output.
- **Append-only formats** (log files, JSONL): these compress well
  because only new bytes are added at the end -- git's delta captures
  this efficiently.

**Key finding:** Git does NOT do content-aware chunking or
deduplication for binary files. It applies the same byte-level delta
algorithm to everything. The algorithm works well only when consecutive
versions share long runs of identical bytes.

### 2.3 SQLite in Git: Measured Reality

A SQLite database storing 100 work items with 20 fields each is
approximately 200-400KB. The problem is not the absolute size but the
**diff amplification**: changing one field value in one row can alter
the SQLite file by 4KB-16KB (one or more B-tree pages plus the
header), none of which is human-readable in `git diff`.

Concrete issues with SQLite in git:

- **No meaningful diffs**: `git diff` shows "Binary files differ."
  Custom textconv drivers (using `sqlite3 .dump`) produce SQL text
  diffs, but these are fragile and not mergeable.
- **No meaningful merges**: two branches modifying different rows
  still produce a binary merge conflict that cannot be resolved
  automatically.
- **WAL/journal files**: SQLite in WAL mode creates `-wal` and `-shm`
  files that must be either excluded from git or carefully managed.
- **Non-deterministic output**: the same logical database content can
  produce different binary files depending on insertion order, vacuum
  state, and page reuse.
- **Repository bloat over time**: each commit stores a full copy (or
  a large delta) of the entire database. 100 commits to a 300KB
  database can mean 5-15MB of pack data, depending on delta
  efficiency.

**Projects that have tried this:**

- `git-sqlite` (cannadayr/git-sqlite) -- custom diff/merge driver
  that dumps SQL; works for diffs but merges remain manual.
- `sqldiff` (sqlite.org) -- computes SQL-level diffs between two
  databases; could be used as a textconv driver.
- The general community consensus (Hacker News, various blog posts):
  "don't store SQLite in git unless you have no alternative."

### 2.4 Git-LFS: Would It Help for SQLite?

Git LFS replaces large files with **pointer files** (tiny text files
containing an OID and size) while storing the actual content on a
separate server. This solves repository bloat but makes the situation
worse for our use case:

- The data is no longer in the repository -- it requires a separate
  LFS server.
- Diffs show pointer file changes, not content changes.
- Offline workflows break without LFS server access.
- Every collaborator must install Git LFS.
- You cannot `git blame` LFS-tracked content.

**Verdict:** LFS is designed for large media assets, not for
source-of-truth data. It is the wrong tool for a context database.

### 2.5 Size Estimates for a Typical Project

| Content | Items | Size per item | Total |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Work items (JSON) | 100 | ~2KB | ~200KB |
| Events (JSON) | 500 | ~0.5KB | ~250KB |
| Decisions (JSON or MD) | 50 | ~3KB | ~150KB |
| Log entries (JSONL) | 1,000 | ~0.3KB | ~300KB |
| RAG embeddings (384 dims x 4 bytes) | 1,000 chunks | 1.5KB | ~1.5MB |
| **Total (without embeddings)** | | | **~900KB** |
| **Total (with embeddings)** | | | **~2.4MB** |

This is small. Even with generous growth (10x), the entire context
database is under 25MB of text/JSON files -- well within git's comfort
zone. The embeddings are the largest component but still modest. A
SQLite database for the same data would be 1-3MB (more compact) but
with all the binary-in-git problems described above.

## 3. Jira's Data Model -- Lessons Learned

### 3.1 Core Architecture

Jira's data model centers on the **issue** as the fundamental entity.
The core tables are:

- **jiraissue** -- the central table: id, key (e.g., PROJ-123),
  summary, description, issue type, status, priority, reporter,
  assignee, created, updated, workflow_id
- **issuelink** -- relationships between issues (blocks, is blocked
  by, relates to, duplicates)
- **issuetype** -- defines issue types (Bug, Story, Task, Epic,
  Sub-task, plus custom types)
- **priority** / **resolution** / **status** -- lookup tables for the
  respective fields
- **project** -- projects with key, lead, and configuration
  references
- **workflowscheme** -- maps workflows to issue types per project

### 3.2 Custom Fields: The EAV Pattern

Jira uses an **Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)** model for custom fields,
stored across three tables:

- **customfield** -- field definitions (id, name, type, description,
  default value)
- **customfieldvalue** -- the actual values (issue_id, customfield_id,
  value as string/number/date)
- **customfieldoption** -- option values for select/multi-select
  fields

This means a custom field "Estimated Hours" on issue PROJ-123 is not a
column on the issue table. It is a row in `customfieldvalue` with
`issue_id=123, customfield_id=10042, numbervalue=4.0`.

**Why this matters for processkit:** The EAV pattern allows unlimited
custom fields without schema migration. But it has known costs:

- **Query complexity**: finding all issues where
  `estimated_hours > 3` requires joining through the EAV tables
  rather than a simple `WHERE` clause.
- **Performance degradation at scale**: Atlassian's own testing shows
  that response times for Create Issue, Edit Issue, and JQL Search
  degrade measurably as custom field count grows from 1,400 to 2,800.
  The degradation is tied to the number of fields in an issue's
  **context** (Project + Issue Type combination).
- **Sparse matrix problem**: most issues have values for only a
  fraction of available custom fields, creating a sparse,
  hard-to-index dataset.

### 3.3 Workflow Engine

Jira workflows are state machines with:

- **Statuses** -- named states (To Do, In Progress, Done, plus custom
  statuses)
- **Transitions** -- edges between statuses, with optional conditions,
  validators, and post-functions
- **Workflow schemes** -- map issue types to workflows per project
  (different types can have different workflows)
- **Screens** -- define which fields are shown/required during each
  transition

This is powerful but creates a configuration explosion. A large Jira
instance can have hundreds of workflows, dozens of schemes, and
thousands of field configurations -- leading to the "Jira admin" role
becoming a full-time job.

### 3.4 What Makes Jira Powerful

- **Flexible schemas**: any field, any type, any project can be
  customized independently.
- **Cross-referencing**: issues link to other issues, epics contain
  stories, components group issues, versions track releases.
- **JQL**: a structured query language that works across all fields
  including custom fields.
- **Per-project configuration**: workflow schemes, field
  configurations, and screens can differ per project.
- **Extensibility**: a rich API and marketplace ecosystem.

### 3.5 What Makes Jira Painful

- **Configuration complexity**: schemes-within-schemes-within-schemes
  create a management burden.
- **Performance at scale**: EAV custom fields, deep permission
  schemes, and complex JQL queries slow down as instances grow.
- **Vendor lock-in**: data lives in Atlassian's database, export is
  lossy and painful.
- **Migration difficulty**: moving between Jira instances or away from
  Jira requires mapping custom fields, workflows, and schemes.
- **UI performance**: large boards, backlogs, and search results are
  notoriously slow.

### 3.6 How Linear Differs

Linear takes the opposite approach: **opinionated simplicity**.

| Aspect | Jira | Linear |
|--------|------|--------|
| Custom fields | Unlimited, any type | Not supported (fixed schema) |
| Workflow customization | Arbitrary state machines | Preset statuses (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, Cancelled) |
| Issue types | Unlimited custom types | Fixed: Issue, Project, Cycle |
| Configuration model | Per-project schemes | Global, minimal |
| Performance | Degrades at scale | Consistently fast |
| Target audience | Any team, any methodology | Engineering teams, opinionated workflow |

**Lesson for processkit:** Jira proves that flexible schemas are
essential for real-world use. Linear proves that you can be opinionated
about workflow while keeping things fast and simple. processkit should
aim for Jira's schema flexibility with Linear's simplicity -- which
means the complexity must live in the data format, not in configuration
layers.

## 4. Storage Architecture Options

### 4.1 Option A: SQLite (Binary Database)

Store all process primitives in a single SQLite database.

**Schema approach:** Core columns for universal fields (id, type,
status, title, created_at) plus a `custom_fields JSON` column for
flexible attributes. SQLite's `json_extract()` and `json_each()`
functions allow querying into JSON columns.

**Advantages:**
- Excellent query performance (indexes, JOINs, aggregations)
- Full SQL expressiveness including JSON functions
- Single file, easy to back up
- Mature Rust support via `rusqlite` with `bundled` feature
- sqlite-vec extension for vector search (already chosen for RAG
  layer)
- Transaction safety (ACID)

**Disadvantages:**
- Binary file in git -- no meaningful diffs, merges, or blame
- Cannot be code-reviewed in a pull request
- Merge conflicts are unresolvable without custom tooling
- Non-deterministic binary output
- Violates "git-native" and "human-readable" constraints

**Verdict:** Excellent as a derived runtime index. Unsuitable as
source of truth.

### 4.2 Option B: JSON-Per-Entity Files

One JSON file per entity in a directory structure:

```
context/
  items/
    WI-001.json
    WI-002.json
  events/
    EVT-001.json
  decisions/
    DEC-001.json
```

**Advantages:**
- Perfect git integration -- each file tracked individually, clean
  diffs, blame per field
- Human-readable (formatted JSON)
- Flexible schema -- any field can be added to any file
- Merge conflicts are rare (different entities = different files) and
  resolvable when they occur
- Cross-references are just ID strings
- JSON Schema validation for flexible-but-validated schemas
- Trivially parseable in any language

**Disadvantages:**
- No built-in query capability -- CLI must scan all files for
  search/filter
- Large directories (1000+ files) slow down `ls` and some editors
- No referential integrity without external validation
- JSON is more verbose than YAML for metadata
- No narrative content support (descriptions are escaped strings in
  JSON)

**Prior art:**
- `git-issues` (steviee/git-issues) -- stores issues as markdown
  files with YAML frontmatter under `.issues/`, zero-padded ID + slug
  filenames. Bidirectional relations, AI-agent friendly.
- `Markdown Projects` (markdownprojects.com) -- stores project state
  as human-readable files under `.mdp/`. Every issue is a markdown
  file with YAML frontmatter.
- `json-repo` (iotshaman/json-repo) -- in-memory repository pattern
  persisting to JSON files.
- `Sir` (Hacker News "git-diff-able JSON database on yer filesystem")
  -- JSON files on the filesystem as a database.

**Failure modes:**
- ID collisions if two branches create entities simultaneously
  (mitigated by prefix namespacing)
- Performance degrades past ~5,000 files in a single directory
  (mitigated by subdirectories)
- No atomic multi-file transactions (git commit is the transaction
  boundary)

### 4.3 Option C: JSONL (JSON Lines)

Append-only files with one JSON record per line:

```
context/
  items.jsonl      # all work items, one per line
  events.jsonl     # all events, one per line
  decisions.jsonl  # all decisions, one per line
```

**Advantages:**
- Git-friendly for appends (new lines = clean diffs)
- Compact (no per-file overhead)
- Easy streaming parse
- Good for event logs and audit trails

**Disadvantages:**
- Editing existing records requires rewriting the entire file --
  produces large, noisy diffs
- Merge conflicts when two branches append to the same file
  simultaneously
- Harder to find a specific record (must scan the file)
- Less human-readable than individual files (must find the right line)
- Not well-suited for entities that are frequently updated (work items
  change status often)

**Verdict:** Good for append-only data (event log, audit trail). Poor
for mutable entities.

### 4.4 Option D: Markdown with YAML Frontmatter

Each entity is a markdown file with structured YAML frontmatter and a
narrative body:

```yaml
---
id: WI-001
type: work-item
status: in-progress
priority: must
created: 2026-03-26
updated: 2026-03-26
assignee: developer
tags: [security, must-fix]
references: [WI-002, DEC-015]
custom:
  estimated_hours: 4
  component: cli
  sprint: 2026-W13
---
# Security review

Conduct a comprehensive security review of the CLI, covering input
validation, file operations, network calls, and supply chain concerns.

## Scope

- Input validation for container names, hostnames, package names
- Symlink following and path traversal in backup/restore
- TLS verification in network calls
...
```

**Advantages:**
- Git-native (plain text files, clean diffs, blame, merge)
- Human-readable -- perhaps the MOST readable of all options
- Flexible schema via the `custom:` map in frontmatter (any key-value
  pairs)
- Machine-parseable via YAML frontmatter parsing (well-established
  libraries)
- Narrative content in markdown body -- descriptions, rationale,
  analysis
- RAG can index the markdown body directly (same chunking strategy as
  existing context files)
- CLI can query the YAML metadata for structured search
- Already the pattern used by processkit entity files
- Already the pattern used by git-issues, Markdown Projects, and
  multiple other tools
- Editors (VS Code, Obsidian, etc.) render frontmatter nicely
- Static site generators (Docusaurus, Jekyll, Hugo) consume this
  format natively

**Disadvantages:**
- YAML parsing is slower than JSON parsing (but negligible for <1000
  files)
- YAML has some gotchas (Norway problem: `no` parsed as boolean,
  unquoted strings)
- Frontmatter fields need a defined schema to avoid chaos
- Query performance requires scanning all files (same as
  JSON-per-entity)
- Less structured than JSON for complex nested data

**Prior art:**
- Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Docusaurus -- all use markdown + frontmatter
  as their data model
- Obsidian -- uses YAML frontmatter for metadata, supports Dataview
  plugin for SQL-like queries over frontmatter
- git-issues -- markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Markdown Projects -- `.mdp/` directory with markdown + frontmatter
- processkit itself -- entity files already use this exact pattern

### 4.5 Option E: SurrealDB Embedded

SurrealDB is a multi-model database (document, graph, relational,
time-series) written in Rust that can run embedded in-process.

**Advantages:**
- Rust-native -- first-class crate, no FFI
- Multi-model: document store with graph relationships and SQL-like
  query language (SurrealQL)
- Schema-flexible (schemaless or schemafull modes)
- Embedded mode uses SurrealKV (custom key-value store) or RocksDB
- Rich query capabilities: JOINs, subqueries, graph traversals

**Disadvantages:**
- Stores data in binary format (SurrealKV or RocksDB) -- same git
  problems as SQLite
- Large dependency (the surrealdb crate pulls in significant
  transitive dependencies)
- Still maturing -- API changes between versions
- Overkill for <1000 entities
- Not human-readable, not git-diffable

**Verdict:** Interesting technology but violates the git-native and
human-readable constraints. Same fundamental problem as SQLite for
source of truth.

### 4.6 Option F: Other Embedded Databases

| Database | Language | Storage | Git-friendly? | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| **PoloDB** | Rust | Binary file | No | MongoDB-like API, ~500KB RAM, but binary storage |
| **redb** | Pure Rust | Binary file (B-tree) | No | Key-value store, stable format, but binary |
| **sled** | Rust | Binary directory | No | Modern embedded DB, but binary + directory |
| **TinyDB** | Python | JSON file | Partially | Single JSON file, not great for git diffs at scale |
| **LowDB** | Node.js | JSON file | Partially | Same as TinyDB -- single file rewrites on every change |
| **DuckDB** | C++ | Binary file | No | Analytical/columnar, wrong use case |
| **libSQL** | C (Rust bindings) | Binary file | No | SQLite fork, same binary problems |

**Verdict:** All binary-format databases share the same fundamental
incompatibility with git. JSON-backed databases (TinyDB, LowDB) store
everything in a single file that is rewritten on every change -- bad
for git diffs. None of these satisfy the constraints.

---

## 5. The Hybrid Architecture: Markdown Source + SQLite Index

The analysis above points to a clear conclusion: **no single storage
engine satisfies all five constraints**. Text files (markdown, JSON)
satisfy git-native, human-readable, and flexible schema. Databases
(SQLite, SurrealDB) satisfy efficient search and query performance.
The solution is a hybrid:

**Markdown+frontmatter files are the source of truth. SQLite is a
derived runtime index.**

### 5.1 Source of Truth: Markdown + YAML Frontmatter

```
context/
  items/
    WI-001.md          # work item with frontmatter + description
    WI-002.md
  events/
    EVT-001.md         # event with frontmatter + details
  decisions/
    DEC-001.md         # decision with frontmatter + rationale
  projects/
    PROJ-001.md        # project with frontmatter + overview
  log/
    events.jsonl       # append-only event log (lightweight events)
```

Each file has YAML frontmatter for structured metadata and a markdown
body for narrative content. The `custom:` map in frontmatter allows
arbitrary user-defined fields.

### 5.2 Derived Index: SQLite + sqlite-vec

```
context/.processkit/
  index.db             # SQLite index (gitignored)
  vectors.db           # Vector embeddings (gitignored, or same file)
```

The CLI builds the index by scanning all markdown files, parsing
frontmatter, and inserting into SQLite tables. The index supports:

- **Structured queries**: SQL query against indexed frontmatter fields
- **Full-text search**: SQLite FTS5 over markdown body text
- **Vector search**: sqlite-vec for RAG embeddings
- **Cross-reference resolution**: find all items that reference a
  given ID
- **Aggregations**: counts by status, priority, type

The index is **derived, not authoritative**. It can be deleted and
rebuilt at any time:

```bash
processkit index rebuild    # scan all context/ files, rebuild index.db
```

### 5.3 Write Path

1. User (or AI agent) creates/edits a markdown file in `context/`
2. The CLI command writes the file
3. After writing, the CLI updates the SQLite index incrementally
   (upsert the changed record)
4. The file is committed to git -- the markdown file IS the commit
   payload

### 5.4 Read Path

1. **Quick queries** hit the SQLite index (fast, sub-millisecond)
2. **Full content** reads the markdown file directly
3. **Semantic search** uses sqlite-vec embeddings
4. If the index is stale or missing, the CLI rebuilds it from the
   markdown files

### 5.5 Schema Validation

Use JSON Schema (or a YAML-compatible equivalent) to validate
frontmatter:

```yaml
# context/.processkit/schemas/work-item.schema.yaml
type: object
required: [id, type, status, title, created]
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    pattern: "^WI-\\d{3,}$"
  type:
    const: work-item
  status:
    enum: [draft, todo, in-progress, blocked, done, cancelled,
           archived]
  priority:
    enum: [must, should, could, wont]
  title:
    type: string
  created:
    type: string
    format: date
  tags:
    type: array
    items: { type: string }
  references:
    type: array
    items: { type: string }
  custom:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: true   # <-- flexible schema!
```

The `custom:` field has `additionalProperties: true`, giving users
Jira-like custom field flexibility without Jira's EAV complexity. The
CLI validates frontmatter on write, catching errors before commit.

---

## 6. Vector Embeddings Storage

### 6.1 Size Analysis

| Scenario | Chunks | Dims | Bytes/vector | Total |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| Small project (20 files) | 200 | 384 | 1,536 | 300KB |
| Medium project (60 files) | 600 | 384 | 1,536 | 900KB |
| Large project (200 files) | 2,000 | 384 | 1,536 | 3MB |
| With metadata overhead (JSON) | 2,000 | 384 | ~2,000 | 4MB |

Embeddings are small enough to store as a JSON file, but JSON encoding
of float arrays is verbose (each float like `0.0234375` takes 9-12
bytes as text vs 4 bytes as binary). A 2,000-chunk embedding file
would be ~15MB in JSON vs ~3MB in binary.

### 6.2 Storage Options

**Option A: SQLite (sqlite-vec)** -- already recommended by the RAG
research. Embeddings stored in a gitignored index file alongside the
structured index. Binary format is fine because embeddings are derived
data, not source of truth.

**Option B: JSON file** -- Human-inspectable but large and slow to
parse. Not recommended.

**Option C: Binary format in gitignored file** -- custom binary or
NumPy-compatible format. Fast but adds complexity without benefit over
SQLite.

**Recommendation:** Store embeddings in the same SQLite database as
the structured index. Both are derived, both are gitignored, and
sqlite-vec is already selected. One file, one rebuild command.

---

## 7. Migration from Monolithic Format

Projects that currently store context in monolithic markdown files
(e.g. all work items in a single markdown table) can migrate to
per-entity files:

```
# Before (monolithic)
context/BACKLOG.md          # 100 items in one table

# After (per-entity)
context/items/WI-001.md     # one item per file
context/items/WI-002.md
...
context/items/WI-100.md
context/BACKLOG.md           # can be retained as a generated overview
```

Migration can be incremental:
1. Keep existing monolithic files as the source of truth initially
2. Add per-entity files alongside them
3. Once the CLI fully supports per-entity operations, deprecate the
   monolithic files
4. Optionally generate monolithic overview files from per-entity files
   (reversed source of truth)

---

## 8. Comparison Matrix

| Criterion | SQLite (binary) | JSON-per-entity | JSONL | Markdown+frontmatter | SurrealDB |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Git-native** | Poor (binary, no diff/merge) | Excellent | Good (append) / Poor (edit) | Excellent | Poor (binary) |
| **Human-readable** | No (requires tooling) | Good (formatted JSON) | Moderate (dense lines) | Excellent (rendered everywhere) | No (binary) |
| **Flexible schema** | Good (JSON columns) | Excellent (any fields) | Excellent (any fields) | Excellent (custom: map) | Excellent (schemaless mode) |
| **Query performance** | Excellent (SQL + indexes) | Poor (file scan) | Poor (line scan) | Poor (file scan) | Excellent (SurrealQL) |
| **RAG support** | Excellent (sqlite-vec) | Good (index files same as MD) | Moderate | Excellent (MD body = RAG input) | Good (built-in vector) |
| **Merge conflicts** | Fatal (binary) | Rare (per-file) | Common (same file) | Rare (per-file) | Fatal (binary) |
| **Narrative content** | Awkward (text in columns) | Awkward (escaped strings) | Awkward (escaped strings) | Native (markdown body) | Awkward (text in documents) |
| **Tooling ecosystem** | Excellent (SQL tools) | Good (JSON tools) | Moderate | Excellent (editors, SSGs, Obsidian) | Growing |
| **Rust library support** | Excellent (rusqlite) | Excellent (serde_json) | Excellent (serde_json) | Good (serde_yaml + pulldown-cmark) | Good (surrealdb crate) |
| **As derived index** | Excellent | N/A | N/A | N/A | Good |
| **As source of truth** | Poor | Good | Moderate | Excellent | Poor |

## 9. Rust Library Support

### For the Recommended Architecture (Markdown+Frontmatter + SQLite Index)

**Source of truth (reading/writing markdown+frontmatter):**

| Crate | Purpose | Maturity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `serde_yaml` | Parse/serialize YAML frontmatter | Stable, widely used |
| `gray_matter` | Extract frontmatter from markdown (like Node.js gray-matter) | Maintained |
| `pulldown-cmark` | Parse markdown body | Stable, reference implementation |
| `serde_json` / `serde` | Serialize structured data, handle `custom:` fields as `Value` | Stable |
| `jsonschema` | Validate frontmatter against JSON Schema | Maintained |

**Derived index (SQLite + vector search):**

| Crate | Purpose | Maturity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `rusqlite` (with `bundled` feature) | SQLite access | Stable, widely used |
| `sqlite-vec` (via rusqlite) | Vector similarity search | Stable enough for embedded use |
| `fastembed` | Generate embeddings (bge-small-en-v1.5) | Maintained, ONNX-based |

**Frontmatter parsing approach in Rust:**

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use serde_yaml::Value;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct WorkItem {
    id: String,
    #[serde(rename = "type")]
    item_type: String,
    status: String,
    title: String,
    created: String,
    #[serde(default)]
    priority: Option<String>,
    #[serde(default)]
    tags: Vec<String>,
    #[serde(default)]
    references: Vec<String>,
    #[serde(default)]
    custom: HashMap<String, Value>,  // flexible schema!
}
```

The `custom: HashMap<String, Value>` field gives Jira-like custom
field support with zero schema migration cost. Users can add any
key-value pairs, and the CLI can query them via the SQLite index.

## 10. Recommendation

### Primary: Markdown + YAML Frontmatter (source of truth) + SQLite (derived index)

This architecture satisfies all five constraints:

| Constraint | How it is satisfied |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Single source of truth** | Markdown files are authoritative. SQLite is derived and gitignored. |
| **Git-native** | Markdown files produce clean diffs, support blame, merge cleanly, and are code-reviewable. |
| **Flexible schema** | The `custom:` map in YAML frontmatter allows arbitrary user-defined fields. JSON Schema validates the known fields. |
| **Efficient search** | SQLite index enables structured queries, FTS5 for full-text, sqlite-vec for vector search. Index rebuilds from source files in seconds. |
| **Human-readable** | Markdown is universally readable. Frontmatter is clear metadata. No tooling required to read. |

### Why Not JSON-Per-Entity?

JSON-per-entity was the second-best option. Markdown+frontmatter wins
because:

1. **Narrative content is first-class**: work items, decisions, and
   events all benefit from rich descriptions. In JSON, descriptions
   are escaped strings. In markdown, they are the natural document
   body.
2. **Existing pattern**: processkit's entity files already use YAML
   frontmatter. Standardizing on this pattern across all context
   artifacts creates consistency.
3. **Editor/tool support**: every code editor, every static site
   generator, and tools like Obsidian understand markdown+frontmatter
   natively.
4. **RAG integration**: the markdown body is directly indexable by RAG
   chunking strategies (heading-based chunking). JSON values are not.

### Why Not Just Keep Monolithic Markdown Files?

A single-table monolithic file (all items in one markdown table) works
for small projects but does not scale:

- Merge conflicts when two agents edit different items simultaneously
- No per-item git blame or history
- No structured query capability without parsing markdown tables
- No validation (typos in status values go unnoticed)
- No custom fields (the table format is rigid)

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Define schemas for core primitives (work-item,
   decision, event, project) as JSON Schema files
2. **Phase 2**: Implement frontmatter read/write in CLI
3. **Phase 3**: Build SQLite index with incremental updates
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate vector search (reuse RAG layer design)
5. **Phase 5**: Migration tool to convert monolithic files to
   per-entity files
6. **Phase 6**: Generate overview files (as computed views) for
   backward compatibility

### JSONL for Append-Only Data

One refinement: use **JSONL** for truly append-only data like the
event log. Events are written once and never edited, making JSONL's
append-friendly, single-file format ideal. The event log can coexist
with per-entity markdown files:

```
context/
  items/WI-001.md            # markdown+frontmatter (mutable)
  decisions/DEC-001.md       # markdown+frontmatter (mutable)
  log/events.jsonl           # JSONL (append-only)
```
