## 1. SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) 6.0

### 1.1 Full Hierarchy

SAFe 6.0 organizes work delivery across four levels, each with
distinct artifacts, ceremonies, and roles:

**Portfolio Level** -- the strategic apex. Connects business strategy
to execution through Lean Portfolio Management (LPM). Three integrated
domains: Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations,
and Lean Governance. Work items at this level are **Epics** -- large
initiatives that flow through a Portfolio Kanban board (states:
Funnel -> Reviewing -> Analyzing -> Portfolio Backlog -> Implementing
-> Done). Each epic requires a **Lean Business Case** before approval.

**Large Solution Level** -- coordinates multiple Agile Release Trains
(ARTs) to deliver complex solutions. Uses a **Solution Train** to
synchronize ARTs. Work items: **Capabilities** (large solution-level
features that span ARTs). This level exists only when a single ART
cannot deliver the full solution.

**ART (Program) Level** -- the primary value delivery mechanism. An
ART is a long-lived team-of-teams (50-125 people, 8-12 agile teams)
aligned to a single value stream. Work items: **Features**
(user-facing value) and **Enablers** (technical infrastructure that
supports future features). The ART operates on a fixed cadence of
**Program Increments (PIs)** -- typically 8-12 weeks comprising 4-5
iterations plus an Innovation and Planning (IP) iteration.

**Team Level** -- cross-functional Agile teams (5-11 people) using
Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid. Work items: **Stories** (user stories and
enabler stories). Teams operate in 2-week iterations within the PI
cadence. Each team has a Scrum Master and Product Owner.

### 1.2 Process Artifacts at Each Level

| Level | Work Items | Key Artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| Portfolio | Epics, Enabler Epics | Lean Business Case, Portfolio Canvas, Strategic Themes |
| Large Solution | Capabilities, Enabler Capabilities | Solution Intent, Solution Context, Solution Roadmap |
| ART | Features, Enabler Features | Program Backlog, PI Objectives, Feature Acceptance Criteria |
| Team | Stories, Enabler Stories | Team Backlog, Iteration Goals, Story Acceptance Criteria |

### 1.3 PI Planning, Inspect & Adapt, Innovation Sprints

**PI Planning** (now called Planning Interval Planning) is a two-day
face-to-face event at the start of each PI where all ART members
align on a shared mission and plan. Outputs: PI Objectives per team,
Program Board (dependency map), ROAM risk board. PI Planning defines
a delivery model using teams-of-teams operating in fixed-width
timeboxes.

**Inspect & Adapt (I&A)** -- a full-day event at the end of each PI.
Three parts:
1. **PI System Demo** -- integrated demo of all features delivered
2. **Quantitative Measurement** -- teams review metrics they have
   agreed to collect, discuss data and trends
3. **Problem-Solving Workshop** -- root cause analysis (fishbone/5
   whys) on the biggest impediment, producing improvement stories
   for the next PI

**Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration** -- the final iteration of
each PI, reserved for innovation, exploration, hackathons,
infrastructure work, and PI Planning prep. Not carrying committed
stories.

### 1.4 Lean Portfolio Management

LPM aligns strategy and execution through three integrated domains:

- **Strategy and Investment Funding:** Establishes Strategic Themes
  and Outcomes that guide investment decisions. Allocates budgets to
  value streams rather than projects. Epics flow through the
  Portfolio Kanban.
- **Agile Portfolio Operations:** Coordinates across ARTs. Manages
  the Portfolio Kanban for visualizing and managing epic flow. The
  mechanism that bridges strategy to approved work is the Lean
  Business Case -- when an epic moves from funnel through analysis,
  the Epic Owner develops a case articulating the hypothesis,
  expected business outcomes, and minimum viable approach.
- **Lean Governance:** Replaces traditional phase-gate governance
  with dynamic budgeting, epic-level guardrails, and continuous
  compliance through built-in quality.

Epic Owners focus on business Epics; Enterprise Architects guide
Enabler Epics (technical enablers).

### 1.5 Built-in Quality and Definition of Done

SAFe mandates built-in quality at every level:
- **Story DoD:** Code complete, unit tested, code reviewed, meets
  acceptance criteria
- **Feature DoD:** All stories done, feature tested end-to-end,
  documentation updated, PO accepted
- **PI DoD:** All committed features done, system demo passed, I&A
  completed, metrics reviewed
- **Release DoD:** Regression passed, performance validated, release
  notes complete

### 1.6 Metrics -- Flow Metrics and Business Agility

SAFe 6.0 introduces six **Flow Metrics** (replacing output-focused
velocity metrics):

1. **Flow Velocity** -- number of completed items in a given
   timeframe
2. **Flow Time** -- total time from start to finish for an item
3. **Flow Efficiency** -- ratio of active work time to total elapsed
   time
4. **Flow Load** -- total number of work items in progress (WIP)
5. **Flow Distribution** -- proportion of work types (features,
   enablers, defects, debt)
6. **Flow Predictability** -- consistency between planned and actual
   delivery

SAFe 6.0 also introduces four new flow articles -- Team Flow, ART
Flow, Solution Train Flow, and Portfolio Flow -- describing how to
apply the eight flow accelerators from Principle #6 at each level.

**Business Agility Assessment** -- SAFe's maturity model. Measures
organizational competence across seven competencies: Team and
Technical Agility, Agile Product Delivery, Enterprise Solution
Delivery, Lean Portfolio Management, Organizational Agility,
Continuous Learning Culture, and Lean-Agile Leadership. The "Measure
and Grow" concept (replacing the older "Metrics" icon in SAFe 6.0)
emphasizes OKRs alongside flow metrics.

### 1.7 Mapping SAFe Concepts to processkit

| SAFe Concept | processkit Mapping | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| PI cadence | Heartbeat cycle | Fixed-cadence agent heartbeat; treat a "PI" as N heartbeat cycles |
| Flow Metrics | Event-sourced metrics | Flow Time = task created->completed from event log; Flow Load = active tasks; Flow Distribution = task tags |
| Portfolio Kanban | Project lifecycle | Scope/Project states map to Kanban columns |
| ART coordination | Department-level sync | Department heads coordinate their agents |
| I&A ceremony | Process watchdog review | Watchdog agent runs periodic retrospective analysis |
| Lean Business Case | Task briefing | PM agent creates task briefings with scope, context, acceptance criteria |
| Built-in quality DoD | Quality gate trigger | Quality gate definitions enforce quality checks |

## 2. PMBOK 7th Edition

### 2.1 Process Groups vs. Performance Domains

The PMBOK 7th Edition (2021) represents a fundamental paradigm shift.
Previous editions (6th and earlier) were organized around **5 Process
Groups** (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling,
Closing) and **49 processes** with prescriptive inputs/tools/outputs.
The 7th Edition abandons this prescriptive approach in favor of
**principles and performance domains** -- recognizing that no single
approach fits all projects.

The shift: from "follow these 49 processes" to "attend to these 8
areas and apply these 12 principles, tailored to your context."

Note: PMBOK 8th Edition is scheduled for release in early 2026,
retaining the principles and performance domains foundation but
simplifying to seven performance domains.

### 2.2 The 8 Performance Domains

The eight performance domains are interactive, interrelated, and
interdependent areas of focus that work together throughout the
project:

1. **Stakeholders** -- identifying, understanding, and engaging the
   stakeholder community. Seeking good working relationships,
   agreement with project objectives, and support for achieving
   goals. Maps to: who cares about the work and how to keep them
   informed.

2. **Team** -- creating a high-performing team that takes shared
   ownership. Covers team composition, leadership styles, team
   development, and conflict management. Maps to: how agents
   collaborate and who leads.

3. **Development Approach and Life Cycle** -- decisions about
   methodology (predictive, adaptive, hybrid) and delivery cadence.
   Maps to: which process template to apply to a project.

4. **Planning** -- ongoing and evolving organization and coordination
   required for successful delivery. Encompasses scope, schedule,
   cost, resource, quality, and communications planning. Maps to:
   how work is structured and sequenced.

5. **Project Work** -- establishing project processes, managing
   physical resources, and managing procurement. The actual execution
   of planned work. Maps to: task execution and resource allocation.

6. **Delivery** -- focused on delivering the intended value and
   meeting quality requirements. Maps to: ensuring outputs match
   acceptance criteria.

7. **Measurement** -- monitoring and controlling delivery through
   metrics, dashboards, and earned value. Maps to: event-sourced
   metrics and progress tracking.

8. **Uncertainty** -- risk management -- identifying, analyzing, and
   responding to risks, ambiguity, and complexity. Maps to: how
   agents handle unknown situations and escalate.

The activities within domains overlap throughout the project, as
opposed to being performed linearly.

### 2.3 Tailoring

PMBOK 7th Edition makes tailoring a first-class concept. The
tailoring process:

1. **Select the development approach** -- predictive, adaptive, or
   hybrid
2. **Tailor for the organization** -- adapt to organizational
   culture, governance, and existing processes
3. **Tailor for the project** -- adapt to project size, complexity,
   risk profile, and stakeholder needs
4. **Implement and improve** -- continuously adjust throughout the
   project based on outcomes

Tailoring is the key concept for processkit: different project types
(research spike, feature development, bug fix) need different process
templates, and the PM agent should select the appropriate template
based on context.

### 2.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

EVM integrates scope, schedule, and cost to measure project
performance. Core variables:

- **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost of work scheduled.
  `PV = Budget x Planned % Complete`
- **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost of work actually performed.
  `EV = Budget x Actual % Complete`
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost incurred for work performed.

Key indices:
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** `SPI = EV / PV` -- >1 means
  ahead of schedule, <1 behind
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** `CPI = EV / AC` -- >1 means
  under budget, <1 over budget
- **Schedule Variance (SV):** `SV = EV - PV`
- **Cost Variance (CV):** `CV = EV - AC`

### 2.5 Mapping PMBOK Concepts to processkit

| PMBOK Concept | processkit Mapping | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Performance domains | Process template categories | Each template covers relevant domains (not all 8 for every project) |
| Tailoring | PM agent process selection | PM agent selects process template based on task type, complexity, risk |
| EVM (adapted) | Token-cost tracking | `PV` = estimated token budget; `EV` = work completed; `AC` = actual tokens spent. SPI/CPI computed per task from event log |
| Measurement domain | Materializer metrics | Event log materializer computes flow metrics and EVM analogues |
| Uncertainty domain | Escalation protocol | Risk events trigger escalation to manager or human (org chart routing) |
| Stakeholder domain | Notification system | Attention badges surface important events to human stakeholders |

## 3. IPMA ICB4

### 3.1 Competence Model -- Three Domains

The IPMA Individual Competence Baseline version 4 (ICB4) defines
competence across three interconnected domains:

**Perspective (5 competence elements):**
- Strategy -- understanding organizational strategy and aligning
  project goals
- Governance, structures and processes -- organizational context for
  projects
- Compliance, standards and regulations -- legal and regulatory
  requirements
- Power and interest -- stakeholder influence dynamics
- Culture and values -- organizational and societal context

**People (10 competence elements):**
- Self-reflection and self-management
- Personal integrity and reliability
- Personal communication
- Relations and engagement
- Leadership
- Teamwork
- Conflict and crisis
- Resourcefulness
- Negotiation
- Results orientation

**Practice (14 competence elements):**
- Project design -- defining how the project will be managed
- Requirements and objectives
- Scope -- what's in and what's out
- Time -- scheduling and time management
- Organisation, information and documentation
- Quality
- Finance
- Resources
- Procurement
- Plan and control
- Risk and opportunity
- Stakeholders
- Change and transformation
- Select and balance (portfolio management)

ICB4 is **competence-based, not process-based** -- it describes what
practitioners should be able to do, not prescriptive steps to follow.
This is a fundamental difference from PMBOK's historical process
orientation.

### 3.2 IPMA Delta -- Organizational Competence Assessment

IPMA Delta is a holistic assessment of organizational competence in
managing projects, using three modules:

1. **Individual assessment (I)** -- evaluates competence of selected
   individuals using ICB4
2. **Project assessment (P)** -- evaluates selected
   projects/programmes using the IPMA Project Excellence Baseline
   (PEB)
3. **Organizational assessment (O)** -- evaluates the organization's
   approach to managing projects using the IPMA Organisational
   Competence Baseline (OCB)

The OCB describes 18 organisational competence elements in 5 groups.
Through the assessment, an organisation gets insights regarding the
current maturity and the Delta to a desired target state.

IPMA Delta classification levels:
- **Class 1:** Initial -- ad-hoc project management
- **Class 2:** Defined -- some standardization exists
- **Class 3:** Standardized -- consistent processes across the
  organization
- **Class 4:** Managed -- quantitative management and continuous
  improvement
- **Class 5:** Optimizing -- innovation-driven, best-in-class

### 3.3 IPMA Certification Levels

| IPMA Level | Title | Description | Agent Level Mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| Level D | Certified Project Management Associate | Has project management knowledge | Junior agent -- follows instructions, limited autonomy |
| Level C | Certified Project Manager | Can manage projects of moderate complexity | Mid-level agent -- manages tasks independently |
| Level B | Certified Senior Project Manager | Can manage complex projects/programmes | Senior agent -- coordinates others, makes decisions |
| Level A | Certified Projects Director | Can manage portfolios/programmes of strategic importance | Principal agent -- strategic direction, mentoring |

### 3.4 Mapping IPMA Concepts to processkit

| IPMA Concept | processkit Mapping | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| ICB4 three domains | Skill tree branches | Perspective/People/Practice -> three skill branches per agent role |
| Competence levels D->A | Agent leveling | Junior->Mid->Senior->Principal maps to IPMA D->C->B->A |
| Delta assessment | Process watchdog evaluation | Watchdog agent assesses organizational competence periodically |
| OCB elements | Department maturity metrics | Track competence per department across the 18 OCB elements |
| Competence-based (not process-based) | Agent capability model | Agents have skills (competences) that determine what tasks they can handle; processes describe the flow, competences describe the capability |

## 4. Process Definition Structure

### 4.1 What Makes a Good Process Document

A process document must answer seven questions:

1. **Why** -- purpose, business justification, when to use this
   process
2. **What** -- inputs required, outputs produced, deliverables
3. **Who** -- roles involved, RACI matrix, approval authority
4. **How** -- step-by-step instructions with decision points and
   quality criteria
5. **When** -- trigger conditions, cadence, duration expectations
6. **Measure** -- metrics for process health, KPIs, SLAs
7. **Improve** -- feedback mechanism, retrospective cadence, owner
   responsible for updates

### 4.2 Template with YAML Frontmatter and Stable Section IDs

Process documents use Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Sections have
**stable IDs** (HTML anchors) separate from heading text, so headings
can evolve without breaking `process_ref` pointers.

```markdown
---
id: proc-release
version: "1.2"
title: Release Process
owner: engineering
triggers:
  - release
  - quality-gate
roles:
  - developer
  - qa
  - pm
maturity: defined
last_reviewed: 2026-03-15
supersedes: null
tags: [delivery, quality]

</section>

<section id="metrics">

## Metrics

- Defect escape rate (bugs found after release)
- Rollback frequency

</section>
```

### 4.3 Stable Section IDs for process_ref

The `process_ref` format uses stable IDs, not heading text:

```yaml
# In a trigger definition
process_ref: "context/processes/release.md#step-test"
```

This points to the `<section id="step-test">` anchor, not the heading
text "Step 1: Test Suite". If the heading is renamed to "Step 1:
Execute Test Suite", the `process_ref` still resolves correctly.

Rules for stable IDs:
- Use lowercase kebab-case: `step-test`, `quality-gate`, `dod`
- Never rename an ID once published -- deprecate and add a new one
  instead
- IDs are unique within a document
- Document the ID in the section tag: `<section id="...">`

### 4.4 Versioning Strategy

Process documents use semantic versioning in the frontmatter:
- **Major version** (1.x -> 2.x): Breaking changes -- steps removed,
  roles changed, section IDs removed
- **Minor version** (1.1 -> 1.2): Additive changes -- new steps, new
  quality criteria, new metrics
- **Patch version** (1.1.1 -> 1.1.2): Clarifications, typo fixes, no
  structural changes

Version history is tracked via git commits on the process document
file. The frontmatter `version` field is the human-readable version;
git SHA provides the immutable reference.

### 4.5 Process Hierarchy

Four levels of process abstraction:

1. **Meta-processes** -- how to create, monitor, and improve processes
   (see section 6)
2. **Standard processes** -- organization-wide process templates
   (e.g., "Release Process", "Feature Development")
3. **Tailored processes** -- standard processes adapted for a specific
   project or team (e.g., "Release Process for Project X" adds
   specific test commands)
4. **Process instances** -- a specific execution of a tailored process
   for a specific task (e.g., "Release v0.5.0")

This hierarchy maps to the CMMI concept of "Standard Process" ->
"Defined Process" -> "Process Instance."

---

## 5. Process Maturity Models

### 5.1 CMMI v3.0

CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) v3.0, released April
2023, integrates Development, Services, and Supplier Management into
a single framework. It defines five maturity levels:

| Level | Name | Description | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Initial | Unpredictable, reactive | Ad-hoc processes, success depends on individual heroics |
| 2 | Managed | Basic project management | Projects are planned and executed per policy; basic metrics collected |
| 3 | Defined | Standardized and documented | Organization-wide standard processes; projects tailor from the standard |
| 4 | Quantitatively Managed | Metrics-driven control | Statistical process control; quantitative quality and performance objectives |
| 5 | Optimizing | Continuous improvement | Innovation-driven; systematic root cause analysis and process optimization |

Key change in CMMI v3.0: Maturity Level 2 is now defined as all
Practice Areas at Capability Level 2 -- a major philosophical shift
from previous versions where ML2 focused on project management. In
v3.0, maturity is the improvement of all processes in parallel.

### 5.2 IPMA Delta Levels

(See section 3.2 above for the 5-class system: Initial -> Defined ->
Standardized -> Managed -> Optimizing)

### 5.3 OPM3 (Organizational Project Management Maturity Model)

PMI's OPM3 differs from CMMI in using a **continuum** rather than
discrete levels. It maps best practices by both domain (Project,
Program, Portfolio) and stage:

1. **Standardize** -- processes are documented and consistently
   applied
2. **Measure** -- metrics are collected on process performance
3. **Control** -- processes are managed to stay within acceptable
   bounds
4. **Continuously Improve** -- processes are systematically improved
   based on data

Three implementation phases: Knowledge (understand maturity),
Assessment (measure current state), Improvement (close the gap).

### 5.4 Process Maturity for AI Agents -- Adapted Model

Traditional maturity models describe human organizations. For AI
agents, we need an adapted model:

| Level | Name | Agent Behavior | Indicators |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ad-hoc | Agent acts on best-effort basis, no consistent process | No process_ref in triggers; no DoD checks; no event logging of process steps |
| 2 | Guided | Agent follows process when explicitly instructed | process_ref exists; agent reads process doc; steps are logged but not enforced |
| 3 | Defined | Agent consistently follows defined process without prompting | Agent autonomously reads process_ref; creates events for each step; watchdog verifies compliance |
| 4 | Measured | Agent tracks process metrics and reports deviations | Agent computes flow metrics per process execution; SPI/CPI tracked; deviations trigger alerts |
| 5 | Optimizing | Agent proposes process improvements based on data | Agent analyzes process metrics over time; suggests process doc updates; implements approved improvements |

**Maturity progression:**
- Level 1->2: Add process_ref to triggers, ensure agents read process
  docs
- Level 2->3: Watchdog agent enforces process compliance on heartbeat
- Level 3->4: Materializer computes process-level metrics from event
  log
- Level 4->5: Agent-driven retrospectives that produce process
  improvement proposals

---

## 6. Meta-Processes

### 6.1 Process for Creating New Processes

A meta-process that governs how new standard processes are created:

```
1. **Identify need** -- PM or team member identifies a recurring
   workflow without a defined process
2. **Draft process document** -- Author creates document using the
   template (section 4.2)
   - Define purpose, steps, roles, DoD, metrics
   - Assign stable section IDs
   - Set initial version to "0.1" (draft)
3. **Review** -- At least one other role reviews for completeness
   and clarity
4. **Trial** -- Execute the process for 2-3 instances, collect
   feedback
5. **Approve** -- PM approves; version set to "1.0"
6. **Register** -- Add to process library index; create trigger
   definitions if applicable
7. **Communicate** -- Inform affected agents via event log
```

### 6.2 Process for Monitoring Process Adherence

How a process watchdog agent evaluates whether agents follow defined
processes:

```
1. **Heartbeat trigger** -- Watchdog runs on its standing task
   heartbeat
2. **Scan active tasks** -- Find tasks with associated process_ref
3. **Check step completion** -- For each task, verify that expected
   process steps have corresponding events
4. **Identify deviations** -- Steps skipped, steps out of order,
   DoD criteria not met
5. **Generate report** -- Create adherence report as event log entry
6. **Escalate** -- If critical deviation found, create attention
   badge for PM or human
7. **Track trends** -- Materializer aggregates adherence scores
   over time
```

### 6.3 Process for Improving Processes (PDCA)

Continuous improvement using the Deming cycle, adapted for AI agents:

**Plan:** Analyze process metrics (flow time, adherence rate, defect
escape rate). Identify the process with the worst performance. Propose
specific improvement (e.g., add a review step, remove a bottleneck
step, clarify quality criteria).

**Do:** Create a modified version of the process document (minor
version bump). Apply the modified process to the next instance.

**Check:** Compare metrics between the old and new process versions.
Did flow time improve? Did quality improve? Did adherence remain high?

**Act:** If improvement validated, promote the new version. If not,
revert and try a different approach. Document the experiment outcome
in the process document's changelog.

### 6.4 Feedback Loops

```
Process Execution -> Event Log -> Materializer -> Metrics
       ^                                           |
Process Update <- Improvement Proposal <- Watchdog Analysis
```

The key insight: all process execution data flows through the event
log, which the materializer aggregates into metrics. The watchdog
agent reads these metrics on its heartbeat and proposes improvements.
The PM agent approves improvements and updates process documents. This
creates a closed feedback loop where processes evolve based on
empirical data.

## 7. Standard Artifact Types

### 7.1 Decision Records (ADR Format)

Enhanced ADR format for a process library:

```markdown
## DEC-NNN: [Title]

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by DEC-XXX
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** What is the situation that requires a decision?
**Decision:** What was decided and why?
**Consequences:** What are the implications -- positive, negative,
    and risks?
**Alternatives considered:** What was rejected and why?
```

### 7.2 Process Definitions

See section 4.2 for the full template. Process definitions are the
core artifact of the process library.

### 7.3 Checklists / Definition of Done Templates

Reusable checklists that can be referenced from process steps:

```markdown
---
id: checklist-code-review
version: "1.0"
title: Code Review Checklist
applies_to: [developer, qa]
---

# Code Review Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Public functions have docstrings
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] No TODO comments without linked task ID
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Performance: no N+1 queries, no unnecessary loops
```

### 7.4 Handoff Templates

Structured information that flows between process steps:

```markdown
---
id: handoff-dev-to-qa
version: "1.0"
title: Developer -> QA Handoff
---

# Developer -> QA Handoff Template

**Summary of work completed:** [What was built/changed]
**How to test:** [Steps to verify the work]
**Known limitations:** [What is not covered, edge cases]
**Artifacts:**
- Code changes: [file list or PR link]
- Test results: [test output or link]
- Documentation: [updated docs]
**Acceptance criteria status:** [Which criteria are met]
```

### 7.5 Quality Gate Definitions

Quality gates are checkpoints that must be passed before work
progresses. They are referenced from trigger definitions:

```markdown
---
id: gate-pre-merge
version: "1.0"
title: Pre-Merge Quality Gate
severity: blocking
---

# Pre-Merge Quality Gate

## Automated Checks
- [ ] All unit tests pass (zero failures)
- [ ] Lint check passes (zero errors)
- [ ] Type check passes (if applicable)
- [ ] Test coverage >= threshold

## Manual Checks
- [ ] Code review approved by at least one reviewer
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] No unresolved TODO comments

## Documentation
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated (if user-facing change)
- [ ] API documentation updated (if public API changed)
```

### 7.6 Retrospective / Lessons Learned Templates

Templates for structured reflection after process execution:

```markdown
---
id: retro-pi
version: "1.0"
title: PI Retrospective Template
cadence: per-PI
---

# PI Retrospective

**Period:** [PI start date] -- [PI end date]
**Participants:** [Agent names]

## Metrics Review
- Flow Velocity: [value vs. previous PI]
- Flow Time (avg): [value vs. previous PI]
- Adherence Rate: [% of process steps followed]
- Defect Escape Rate: [bugs found after completion]

## What Went Well
1. [Item]

## What Didn't Go Well
1. [Item]

## Action Items
| Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Action] | [Agent] | [Date] | Todo |
```

---

## 8. Architectural Implications for processkit

### 8.1 Process Storage Format: Markdown with Frontmatter

**Decision: Use Markdown files with YAML frontmatter** (not database,
not pure YAML).

Rationale:
- Agents already read and write Markdown fluently
- Git provides version history, diffs, and blame
- YAML frontmatter provides structured metadata for programmatic
  access
- Stable section IDs (`<section id="...">`) enable precise
  `process_ref` pointers
- Human-readable without tooling
- Aligns with processkit's existing pattern (context files, process
  docs are already Markdown)

Alternative rejected: Pure YAML process definitions. Too rigid, poor
readability for complex multi-step processes, hard for agents to
author naturally.

Alternative rejected: Database-stored processes. Adds persistence
complexity, loses git history, harder for humans to review and edit.

### 8.2 How process_ref Works with Stable IDs

The `process_ref` field in trigger definitions resolves to a specific
section:

```yaml
# triggers/release.yaml
name: "/release"
process_ref: "context/processes/release.md#step-test"
```

Resolution logic:
1. Parse the path: `context/processes/release.md` -> file path
2. Parse the fragment: `#step-test` -> section ID
3. Read the file, find `<section id="step-test">` or heading with
   `{#step-test}`
4. Extract the section content (up to the next section boundary)
5. Provide the section content to the agent as process instructions

If no fragment is specified, the entire document is provided.

### 8.3 Event-Sourced Maturity Tracking

Process maturity per agent and per department is tracked through the
event log:

```python
# Event types for process tracking
"process_step_started"     # Agent began a process step
"process_step_completed"   # Agent completed a process step
"process_step_skipped"     # Agent skipped a step (deviation)
"process_dod_checked"      # Agent verified DoD criteria
"process_dod_failed"       # DoD check failed
"process_adherence_report" # Watchdog adherence report
```

Maturity score computation:
- **Adherence rate** = completed steps / expected steps (per process
  instance)
- **DoD compliance** = passed DoD checks / total DoD checks
- **Process coverage** = tasks with process_ref / total tasks
- **Improvement rate** = process improvements proposed / PIs elapsed

These metrics are computed by the materializer and stored as
materialized views for dashboard display.

### 8.4 Meta-Process Enforcement

The process watchdog agent enforces meta-processes:

1. **On heartbeat:** Scan for active tasks with process_ref; check
   event log for step completion
2. **On task completion:** Verify DoD before allowing status
   transition
3. **On PI boundary (periodic):** Generate adherence report; compare
   current PI to previous
4. **On process document change:** Validate the change follows the
   meta-process for updating processes

The watchdog operates autonomously on its standing task heartbeat but
escalates to PM or human for critical deviations.

### 8.6 Recommended Build Order

Based on this research, the recommended implementation sequence for
process library features:

1. **Process document template** -- Define the standard
   Markdown+frontmatter template (section 4.2). Convert existing
   process docs to the new format with stable section IDs. No code
   changes needed.

2. **process_ref resolver** -- Implement the logic to parse
   `process_ref` with fragment IDs and extract section content.
   Integrate into trigger activation.

3. **Process step events** -- Add process-specific event types to the
   event log. Agents emit `process_step_started/completed` events as
   they execute process steps.

4. **Process templates** -- Create standard process templates for
   common workflows (feature development, research spike, bug fix,
   release). PM agent selects template when structuring work.

5. **Watchdog adherence checking** -- Extend the process watchdog to
   compare event log against process definitions and generate
   adherence reports.

6. **Maturity metrics** -- Extend the materializer to compute process
   maturity metrics (adherence rate, DoD compliance, process
   coverage). Surface on dashboard.

7. **Tailoring framework** -- Enable PM agent to create tailored
   processes from standard templates based on project characteristics
   (size, risk, complexity).

8. **Process improvement loop** -- Enable watchdog to propose process
   improvements based on metric trends. PM agent reviews and approves
   changes.
