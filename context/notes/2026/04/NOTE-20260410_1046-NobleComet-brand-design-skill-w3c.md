# Brand & Design Skill Category Research

**Date:** 2026-03-26
**Status:** Research complete, ready for decision

---

## 1. Problem Statement

processkit ships 85+ skills across 14 categories. The "Design &
Visual" category contains 7 skills (excalidraw, logo-design,
infographics, frontend-design, tailwind, pixijs-gamedev,
mobile-app-design) but none address **brand identity as a system**
— creating and maintaining a coherent brand package with design
tokens, color systems, typography, voice guidelines, and usage
rules.

Meanwhile, the ecosystem has noticed this gap. Anthropic's own
skills repository (`anthropics/skills`) now ships a
`brand-guidelines` skill. ComposioHQ's awesome-claude-skills
collection includes one. Marie Claire Dean's 63-skill design
collection covers design systems and brand auditing. Claude.com has
a dedicated resource page titled "Package your brand guidelines in
a skill." None of these are comprehensive enough for processkit's
curated, reference-backed approach.

---

## 2. What Goes in a Brand Package

Based on industry best practices, the W3C Design Tokens
specification (stable since October 2025), and analysis of
open-source brand repos (dotnet/brand, base/brand-kit, GitHub
Brand Toolkit, Carbon Design System):

### 2.1 Core Components

| Component | Contents | Formats |
|---|---|---|
| **Design tokens** | Colors, typography, spacing, border radius, shadows, breakpoints, motion | W3C DTCG JSON (source of truth), CSS custom properties, Tailwind `@theme`, SCSS variables, JS/TS module |
| **Logo system** | Primary, horizontal, stacked, icon-only, wordmark-only, monochrome, reversed | SVG (canonical), PNG at standard sizes (32, 180, 192, 512, 1024), ICO for favicon |
| **Color system** | Primary, secondary, accent, neutrals (10-shade scale), semantic (success, warning, error, info), dark/light mode mappings | Defined as tokens; OKLCH for perceptual uniformity, with HEX/RGB fallbacks |
| **Typography** | Heading + body + code font families, size scale, weight scale, line heights, letter spacing | Font files (WOFF2), composite design tokens |
| **Brand voice** | Tone attributes, writing principles, vocabulary (preferred/avoided), example copy | Markdown guidelines |
| **Usage guidelines** | Logo clear space, minimum sizes, color do's/don'ts, dark mode rules, co-branding | Markdown with inline SVG examples |
| **Templates** | Social cards (OG 1200x630), presentation slides, letterhead, README badges | SVG templates, HTML/CSS |

### 2.2 Repository Structure (Recommended)

```

### 2.3 Design Token Format (W3C DTCG 2025.10)

The W3C Design Tokens Community Group published the first stable
specification in October 2025. This is now the standard format,
with support from Style Dictionary, Figma, Tokens Studio, and all
major design tools.

```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": {
      "$value": "oklch(0.65 0.19 260)",
      "$type": "color",
      "$description": "Primary brand color"
    },
    "on-primary": {
      "$value": "oklch(0.99 0 0)",
      "$type": "color",
      "$description": "Text/icon color on primary surfaces"
    }
  },
  "font": {
    "heading": {
      "$value": "Inter, system-ui, sans-serif",
      "$type": "fontFamily"
    },
    "code": {
      "$value": "JetBrains Mono, monospace",
      "$type": "fontFamily"
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "xs": { "$value": "0.25rem", "$type": "dimension" },
    "sm": { "$value": "0.5rem", "$type": "dimension" },
    "md": { "$value": "1rem", "$type": "dimension" },
    "lg": { "$value": "1.5rem", "$type": "dimension" },
    "xl": { "$value": "2rem", "$type": "dimension" }
  }
}
```

The token pipeline: **DTCG JSON** (source) -> **Style Dictionary**
(transform) -> **CSS / Tailwind / SCSS / JS** (outputs).

## 3. Existing AI Brand/Design Tools

### 3.1 AI Brand Generation Platforms

| Tool | Capabilities | Output Quality | Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brandmark.io** | AI logo + business card + social graphics | Raster-focused, basic | Low — visual-only, no tokens |
| **Looka** | Logo + brand kit (colors, fonts, templates) | Good for non-designers | Medium — generates starting assets |
| **uBrand** | Logo + mockups + brand videos + color cards | Comprehensive but GUI | Low — not agent-compatible |
| **Ironov.ai** | Neural network logo generation | Creative but unpredictable | Low — image-only |
| **Ad Legends Brand Kit** | Extract brand identity from any website; export CSS/JSON/Shadcn | High for extraction | High — token extraction useful |
| **Figma AI Brand Guidelines** | Generate guidelines from Figma libraries | Excellent for Figma users | Medium — depends on Figma |

### 3.2 Design Token Tooling

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Style Dictionary** (Amazon) | Transform DTCG JSON tokens to any platform format | Mature, DTCG-native since v4 |
| **Tokens Studio** (Figma plugin) | Visual token management, DTCG export | Production, W3C compliant |
| **sd-tailwindcss-transformer** | Style Dictionary plugin for Tailwind config generation | Stable, community maintained |
| **Penpot** | Open-source design tool with token support | Growing, DTCG-aligned |

### 3.3 Existing Agent Skills for Brand Work

| Skill / Source | Scope | Gap vs. processkit needs |
|---|---|---|
| **anthropics/skills brand-guidelines** | Generic brand guidelines packaging | No design tokens, no generation, no audit |
| **ComposioHQ brand-guidelines** | Anthropic-specific brand colors/typography | Company-specific, not generalizable |
| **Marie Claire Dean's design collection** | 63 skills including design systems, brand auditing | Broad but shallow; no token pipeline |
| **claudeskills.org brand-guidelines** | Brand voice and visual consistency | Voice-focused, weak on technical implementation |
| **Antigravity UI/UX skills** | UI component design, not brand identity | Different scope |

**Key gap:** No existing agent skill covers the full brand package
lifecycle — creation of design tokens in W3C DTCG format,
generation of multi-format outputs (CSS/Tailwind/SCSS/JS), logo
variant management, and brand consistency auditing. This is the
opportunity for processkit.

---

## 4. Proposed Skills

### 4.1 brand-package (Priority: High)

**Purpose:** Create and maintain a complete brand identity package
with machine-readable design tokens and human-readable guidelines.

**When to use:** When the user asks to create a brand identity, set
up design tokens, define a color system, establish typography,
create brand guidelines, or scaffold a brand repository.

**Key capabilities:**
- Scaffold a brand repository with the structure from section 2.2
- Define design tokens in W3C DTCG JSON format (colors, typography,
  spacing, shadows, breakpoints, motion)
- Generate multi-format token outputs: CSS custom properties,
  Tailwind `@theme`, SCSS variables, JS/TS modules
- Configure Style Dictionary build pipeline (JSON source -> all
  outputs)
- Define color systems: primary/secondary/accent/neutral scales,
  semantic mappings, dark/light mode
- Select and configure typography: heading + body + code fonts,
  size/weight/line-height scales
- Write brand voice guidelines from user input (tone attributes,
  vocabulary, examples)
- Write usage guidelines (logo clear space, color do's/don'ts,
  accessibility requirements)
- Generate social card and badge SVG templates

**Tools:** `Bash(npm:*) Bash(npx:*) Read Write`

**References:**
- `references/dtcg-token-format.md` — W3C DTCG JSON schema, token
  types, composite tokens, theming
- `references/brand-repo-structure.md` — Repository layout, file
  naming, build pipeline setup
- `references/color-system-guide.md` — OKLCH color space, contrast
  requirements, dark mode, semantic mapping

**Relationship to existing skills:**
- Extends `logo-design` (brand-package references logo variants;
  logo-design handles SVG construction)
- Feeds into `tailwind` (brand-package generates `@theme` tokens
  that tailwind skill consumes)
- Feeds into `frontend-design` (design tokens drive component
  theming)

### 4.2 style-guide (Priority: Medium)

**Purpose:** Create living style guides — browsable HTML/CSS
documentation of a brand package, with rendered component examples
and copy-paste code snippets.

**When to use:** When the user asks to create a style guide,
document their design system visually, or generate a component
showcase from their brand tokens.

**Key capabilities:**
- Generate a static HTML style guide from design tokens (color
  swatches, typography specimens, spacing scale)
- Render logo variants at multiple sizes with background previews
- Show color accessibility matrix (contrast ratios for all
  text/background combinations)
- Generate component examples: buttons, cards, forms, navigation,
  with token-driven theming
- Produce both light and dark mode previews side by side
- Export as standalone HTML (no build step) or as a page within an
  existing docs site

**Tools:** `Bash(npm:*) Bash(npx:*) Read Write`

**References:**
- `references/style-guide-patterns.md` — Page structure, section
  templates, accessibility matrix generation

**Relationship to existing skills:**
- Consumes output of `brand-package` (reads design tokens)
- Complements `documentation` skill (style guide is a specific
  documentation type)

### 4.3 design-system (Priority: Medium)

**Purpose:** Design component libraries using atomic design
principles, token-driven theming, and accessibility-first patterns.

**When to use:** When the user asks to create a component library,
design a UI kit, implement theming across components, or set up a
design system with tokens.

**Key capabilities:**
- Apply atomic design: atoms (button, input) -> molecules (search
  bar) -> organisms (header) -> templates -> pages
- Wire design tokens to components via CSS custom properties (not
  hardcoded values)
- Implement multi-theme support: brand themes via token swap,
  dark/light mode, high-contrast mode
- Define component API surfaces: props, variants, slots, compound
  components
- Ensure accessibility in every component: keyboard navigation,
  ARIA, focus management, contrast
- Document component states: default, hover, focus, active,
  disabled, loading, error
- Set up component testing: visual regression, accessibility
  audits, interaction testing

**Tools:** `Bash(npm:*) Bash(npx:*) Read Write`

**References:**
- `references/atomic-design-reference.md` — Atomic levels,
  composition patterns, token-to-component wiring
- `references/component-api-patterns.md` — Props design, variant
  patterns, accessibility requirements per component

**Relationship to existing skills:**
- Builds on `brand-package` (consumes design tokens) and
  `frontend-design` (component architecture)
- Extends `tailwind` (Tailwind is one implementation path for
  token-driven components)

### 4.4 visual-identity-audit (Priority: Low-Medium)

**Purpose:** Review existing brand assets for consistency,
accessibility, and completeness.

**When to use:** When the user asks to audit their brand, check for
consistency issues, verify accessibility compliance, or identify
missing brand assets.

**Key capabilities:**
- Check token completeness: all required categories present (color,
  typography, spacing, shadow, breakpoint)
- Verify color accessibility: WCAG AA/AAA contrast ratios for all
  text/background combinations
- Verify color accessibility: simulate deuteranopia, protanopia,
  tritanopia on color palette
- Check logo variants: all required lockups present, render at
  16/32/180/512px, test on light/dark/colored backgrounds
- Check dark mode: all semantic tokens have dark mode mappings,
  contrast ratios pass in both modes
- Check typography: font files present, fallback stack defined,
  size scale is consistent
- Detect inconsistencies: hardcoded colors that should be tokens,
  mismatched font stacks, orphaned variables
- Generate audit report with pass/fail/warning per criterion and
  remediation suggestions

**Tools:** `Bash(npm:*) Bash(npx:*) Read Write`

**References:**
- `references/audit-checklist.md` — Complete checklist: tokens,
  colors, logos, typography, voice, templates

**Relationship to existing skills:**
- Audits output of `brand-package`, `style-guide`, `design-system`
- Extends accessibility checks from `frontend-design`

## 5. Category Placement

### 5.1 Current "Design & Visual" Category Analysis

The existing category mixes three distinct concerns:

| Concern | Skills | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Brand & Identity** | logo-design | Creating brand assets |
| **UI/Frontend** | frontend-design, tailwind, mobile-app-design | Building user interfaces |
| **Creative/Visual** | excalidraw, infographics, pixijs-gamedev | Diagrams, charts, games |

Adding 4 more brand skills to this 7-skill category would tip it
to 11 skills — the largest category — with an even more confused
identity.

### 5.2 Options

**Option A: Split into two categories**

| Category | Skills (new in bold) |
|---|---|
| **Brand & Design System** (new) | logo-design, **brand-package**, **style-guide**, **design-system**, **visual-identity-audit** |
| **UI & Visual** (renamed) | frontend-design, tailwind, mobile-app-design, excalidraw, infographics, pixijs-gamedev |

- Pros: Clean separation of concerns. Brand skills cluster
  naturally. UI skills remain grouped.
- Cons: logo-design moves away from its current neighbors. Two
  smaller categories instead of one medium.

**Option B: Keep one category, add subcategory headers**

The docs page already lists skills with `###` headings. Add a
visual grouping:

```
# Design & Visual Skills

## Brand & Identity
- brand-package
- logo-design
- style-guide
- design-system
- visual-identity-audit

## UI & Frontend
- frontend-design
- tailwind
- mobile-app-design

## Creative & Diagrams
- excalidraw
- infographics
- pixijs-gamedev
```

- Pros: No structural change to the category system. Easy to
  implement.
- Cons: Category grows to 12 skills. Subcategories are cosmetic
  (docs-only), not reflected in the skill system itself.

**Option C: Create a new "Brand" category**

| Category | Skills |
|---|---|
| **Brand** (new) | **brand-package**, logo-design, **style-guide**, **design-system**, **visual-identity-audit** |
| **Design & Visual** (unchanged minus logo-design) | frontend-design, tailwind, mobile-app-design, excalidraw, infographics, pixijs-gamedev |

- Pros: Dedicated category signals brand work is a first-class
  concern. Clean.
- Cons: "Brand" is a narrow category name for 5 skills. May feel
  over-specialized vs. other categories.

### 5.3 Recommendation: Option A (Split into two categories)

**"Brand & Design System"** and **"UI & Visual"** are the clearest
split. The brand skills form a natural pipeline (brand-package ->
style-guide -> design-system -> visual-identity-audit), while the
UI skills are about building interfaces. logo-design belongs with
brand work because logos are brand assets, not UI components.

This brings the category count from 14 to 15 and keeps both
categories at 5-6 skills — consistent with other categories
(Architecture: 4, API: 4, Security: 5, Observability: 4).

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: brand-package skill (immediate)

1. Create `templates/skills/brand-package/SKILL.md`
2. Create reference files:
   - `references/dtcg-token-format.md` — DTCG JSON schema, token
     types, Style Dictionary config
   - `references/brand-repo-structure.md` — Recommended directory
     layout, file inventory
   - `references/color-system-guide.md` — OKLCH, contrast math,
     dark mode, semantic mapping
3. Populate a brand repo using the skill (dogfooding)
4. Add to docs-site

### Phase 2: visual-identity-audit skill (near-term)

1. Create skill with audit checklist reference
2. Run audit against the brand repo (dogfooding)
3. This validates both the skill and the brand package

### Phase 3: style-guide + design-system skills (medium-term)

1. Create both skills with reference materials
2. These build on a populated brand repo and are less urgent until
   brand-package exists

### Phase 4: Category restructure

1. Split "Design & Visual" into "Brand & Design System" + "UI &
   Visual"
2. Update docs-site sidebar and category pages
3. Update skill mapping (these skills likely belong in a future
   `brand` process package or remain as manual-include skills)

---

## 7. Process Package / Addon Mapping

These skills are not tied to a specific programming language or
tool, so they do not naturally map to an addon. Options:

| Mapping | Skills | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **New "brand" process package** | brand-package, style-guide, design-system, visual-identity-audit | Auto-deployed when user selects brand work. Includes logo-design. |
| **Standalone (manual include)** | All four | Users add via `[skills] include = ["brand-package", ...]`. Simpler but less discoverable. |
| **docs-docusaurus addon** | style-guide | If the user has Docusaurus, a style guide page is natural. |

**Recommendation:** Start as standalone skills (manual include).
Once all four exist and are validated, create a "brand" process
package that bundles them with logo-design. This avoids premature
packaging.
