## 2. Validation Scenarios as User Stories

### Scenario 1: Solo Dev Starts a New Project

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want to run a single command to set up a fully configured
> project with work tracking and AI context, so that I can start
> coding without spending time on infrastructure setup.

**Preconditions:**
- Alex has processkit installed on the host machine
- No existing project directory

**Flow:**
1. Alex runs: `processkit init myproject --process managed`
2. processkit creates the project directory and config
3. processkit scaffolds `context/` with the "managed" primitives:
   - `context/items/` directories for work items, decisions, actors,
     roles
   - `context/events/` for event log
   - `context/schemas/` for state machines and categories
4. processkit creates the Actor entity for Alex (from git config or
   interactive prompt)
5. processkit creates a default Admin role and assigns Alex to it
6. processkit installs managed skills: `event-log-management`,
   `workitem-management`, `decision-record-management`,
   `actor-profile-management`, `role-management`,
   `context-archiving`, `standup-context`, `session-handover`
7. Alex enters the project
8. Agent reads CLAUDE.md -> context/ -> skills -> is immediately
   productive

**Validation questions:**
- What does the agent see on first session? Is there enough context
  to be useful?
- How does Alex add the first work item? Does the skill guide the
  agent?
- What files exist after init? Is it overwhelming or intuitive?
- Is 5 minutes from `processkit init` to "working on my first task"
  realistic?

---

### Scenario 2: User Has an Idea for a Feature

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want to tell my AI agent about a feature idea and have
> it properly tracked, so that I don't lose ideas and can prioritize
> them later.

**Preconditions:**
- Project is running with "managed" package
- Alex is in an active session with the agent

**Flow:**
1. Alex says: "I have an idea — we should add dark mode toggle to
   the settings page"
2. Agent recognizes this as a feature idea -> uses
   `workitem-management` skill
3. Agent generates a word-ID for the work item
4. Agent creates the work item file with:
   - Frontmatter: kind: WorkItem, state: draft, subtype: feature,
     priority: medium
   - Level 1 intro: one-line summary
   - Level 2: description of what dark mode means
   - Level 3: (empty for now — details to be fleshed out later)
5. Agent logs creation event via `event-log-management` skill
6. Agent confirms to Alex: "Created work item — 'Dark mode toggle'.
   Priority medium, state draft."
7. Agent updates INDEX.md for the work items directory

**Validation questions:**
- Is the flow natural? Does the agent need to ask Alex for details
  or can it infer?
- What if Alex says "add to backlog" vs "create a ticket" vs "I have
  an idea"? Does the "When to Use" section cover all these phrasings?
- Does the agent know to set priority medium by default, or should
  it ask?
- Is the file structure correct? Does the three-level rule produce a
  useful document?

---

### Scenario 3: User Asks "What Am I Working On?"

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want to ask my agent for a status overview and get an
> accurate picture of my work, so that I can decide what to focus on
> today.

**Preconditions:**
- Project has 15 work items in various states
- Fresh session, agent reads files directly

**Flow:**
1. Alex says: "What am I working on? What's the status?"
2. Agent uses `workitem-management` skill -> reads
   `context/items/work/` directory
3. Agent scans all .md files, reads frontmatter (kind, state,
   priority, owner)
4. Agent groups by state and presents:
   ```
   In Progress (3):
   - Dark mode toggle (medium)
   - API auth refactor (high)
   - Fix login timeout (critical)

   Ready (5): ...
   Blocked (1): DB migration (blocked by API auth refactor)
   Draft (6): ...
   ```
5. Agent suggests: "The login timeout fix is critical — should we
   focus there?"

**Validation questions:**
- With 15 items, scanning files is fine. What about 500? 5000? At
  what point does the agent need the SQLite index?
- Does the agent read full files or just frontmatter?
  (Frontmatter-only scan would be much faster)
- How does the agent know which items are assigned to Alex vs someone
  else?
- Should the agent check the event log for recent activity too?

---

### Scenario 4: Work Item Lifecycle Across Multiple Sessions

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want my work items to maintain continuity across sessions
> with different agents, so that context is never lost when I resume
> work.

**Preconditions:**
- An in-progress work item assigned to Alex
- Alex ends session (agent A does handover)
- Alex starts new session (agent B picks up)

**Flow — Session 1 (Agent A):**
1. Alex works on the work item for 2 hours
2. Agent A logs events: started work, discovered dependency, made
   design decision
3. Alex says "let's wrap up" -> agent A uses `session-handover` skill
4. Agent A creates handover document referencing the work item,
   events logged, open questions, and next steps

**Flow — Session 2 (Agent B):**
1. Agent B starts, reads CLAUDE.md -> context/ -> latest handover
   document
2. Agent B reads the work item entity file + recent events in event
   log
3. Agent B says: "Welcome back. Last session you were working on the
   API auth refactor. You discovered a dependency and made a decision
   to use JWT instead of session tokens. Next steps were: implement
   the token refresh endpoint."
4. Alex confirms, work continues seamlessly

**Validation questions:**
- Does the handover document contain enough for Agent B to be
  immediately useful?
- What if there were 20 events in the session — is the handover too
  verbose?
- Does Agent B know to look at the handover, or does it need
  instructions in CLAUDE.md?
- What if Alex doesn't explicitly say "wrap up" — are events still
  useful on their own?

---

### Scenario 5: Two Humans Collaborate with RBAC

**Persona:** Maria (Team Lead) + Bob (Developer on Maria's team)

**User Story:**
> As Maria, I want my team's agents to respect role-based access
> control, so that developers can't accidentally change release
> processes or role assignments.

**Preconditions:**
- Project with "software" package
- Maria has Admin role; Bob has Developer role
- Release process defined

**Flow — Bob tries to modify a process:**
1. Bob says to his agent: "Change the release process to skip the
   staging deploy"
2. Agent reads Bob's actor profile -> sees Developer role
3. Agent reads Developer role -> sees restriction: "Cannot modify
   kind: Process, StateMachine, Gate, Constraint, Role"
4. Agent responds: "I can't modify the release process — your
   Developer role restricts process changes. Talk to Maria (Admin)
   if you need this changed."
5. Agent logs an escalation event

**Flow — Maria modifies the process:**
1. Maria says: "Remove the staging deploy step from the release
   process"
2. Agent reads Maria's actor profile -> sees Admin role -> no
   restriction on Process
3. Agent edits the release process, removes the staging step
4. Agent logs the modification event
5. Agent confirms: "Updated the release process. Removed staging
   deploy step."

**Validation questions:**
- Is the RBAC check natural, or does it feel like a blocker?
- What if Bob has a legitimate urgent need? Does escalation feel
  reasonable?
- How does the agent know who is currently speaking? (git config?
  explicit identity?)
- What if Bob says "I got Maria's approval verbally"? How strict is
  the agent?

---

### Scenario 6: Design Discussion Leading to a Decision

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want to have a structured discussion with my AI agent
> about a design choice and record the decision, so that future me
> (or a client) understands why I chose PostgreSQL over SQLite.

**Preconditions:**
- Project is running, Alex is working on a database choice

**Flow:**
1. Alex says: "Let's discuss whether to use PostgreSQL or SQLite for
   this project"
2. Agent uses `discussion-management` skill -> creates a discussion
3. Agent structures the discussion: context, arguments for each
   option, trade-offs
4. Alex and agent go back and forth, adding arguments
5. Agent records each point in the discussion body
6. Alex says: "OK, let's go with PostgreSQL"
7. Agent uses `decision-record-management` -> creates a decision
   record
8. Agent links the decision to the discussion
9. Agent logs decision event
10. Discussion state -> concluded

**Validation questions:**
- Does the discussion entity add value over just chatting and
  recording a decision?
- When should the agent suggest creating a formal discussion vs just
  answering?
- Is the discussion -> decision flow smooth or too bureaucratic for a
  solo dev?
- How does this discussion survive across sessions? (It's a file —
  naturally persistent)

---

### Scenario 7: Setting Up a Weekly Review Cadence

**Persona:** Dr. Priya (Research Scientist)

**User Story:**
> As Priya, I want to set up a weekly review cadence where my agent
> reminds me to review lab progress, so that experiments and papers
> stay on track.

**Preconditions:**
- Project with "research" package (or managed + schedule skill added)
- Priya's lab has 3 active research streams

**Flow:**
1. Priya says: "I want a weekly review every Friday afternoon"
2. Agent uses `schedule-management` skill -> creates a schedule
3. Agent creates the schedule entity: pattern "weekly(friday)",
   cadence type, links to a review process template
4. Following Friday, Priya starts a session
5. Agent checks active schedules -> sees the weekly review is due
6. Agent says: "Weekly review is due. Last review was 7 days ago.
   Shall I prepare a summary of this week's progress?"
7. Agent reads recent events, groups by research stream, presents
   status
8. Priya reviews, makes decisions, agent logs everything

**Validation questions:**
- The agent checks schedules at session start — but only if it knows
  to. Is this instruction in CLAUDE.md or in the skill?
- What if Priya doesn't start a session on Friday? Does Saturday's
  session still remind? (Yes — "overdue by 1 day")
- How much preparation can the agent do automatically vs needing to
  ask?
- Does the "research" package include schedule-management?
  (Currently: no — gap!)

---

### Scenario 8: Schema Migration (v1 -> v2)

**Persona:** Alex (Solo Developer)

**User Story:**
> As Alex, I want version updates to be safe and guided, so that my
> project context isn't broken by schema changes.

**Preconditions:**
- Project initialized with v1 (apiVersion: v1)
- Alex updates the CLI to v2
- v2 adds a required `metadata.labels.priority` field to WorkItem

**Flow:**
1. Alex runs `processkit update` -> CLI updates to v2
2. processkit stores new templates in
   `context/.processkit/templates/v2.0.0/`
3. processkit generates `context/.processkit/migration/v1-to-v2.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Migration: v1 -> v2

   ## Changes
   - WorkItem: `metadata.labels.priority` is now required
     (was optional in spec)
   - Event schema: added `correlation_id` field (optional)
   - New kind: Override (for template customization)

   ## Instructions for your agent
   - Scan all WorkItem files. For any without
     `metadata.labels.priority`, add it based on the existing
     `spec.priority` field.
   - Update `apiVersion: v1` to `apiVersion: v2` in all entity
     files.
   - Never edit files without asking the user first.
   ```
4. Alex's agent reads the migration document in next session
5. Agent says: "processkit updated to v2. There's a migration to
   apply — 23 work items need a `labels.priority` field added.
   Shall I proceed?"
6. Alex approves, agent migrates files one by one, logging events

**Validation questions:**
- Is the migration prompt clear enough for any agent to follow?
- What if the agent makes a mistake during migration? (Git provides
  rollback)
- Should `processkit lint` detect pre-migration state and warn?
- How does this work for large projects (5000 files to migrate)?

---

### Scenario 9: Project Grows to 5,000 Work Items

**Persona:** Maria (Team Lead)

**User Story:**
> As Maria, I want the context system to remain performant as my
> project grows, so that my team's agents aren't slowed down by scale.

**Preconditions:**
- Project has been running for 18 months
- 5,000 work items (3,500 done, 800 archived, 700 active)
- Event log has 50,000+ entries

**Flow:**
1. Maria's agent starts a session
2. Agent needs to find active work items -> scans
   `context/items/work/`
3. With monthly sharding: `context/items/work/2024/06/` through
   `2026/03/` — 24 month directories, ~200 files each
4. Agent reads only the most recent months (active items are recent)
5. For historical queries: agent suggests `processkit sync` to
   rebuild the SQLite index, then queries the index
6. For metrics: agent reads events from recent months' JSONL files,
   computes lead time, throughput, etc.

**Validation questions:**
- Can the agent efficiently find "active items only" without reading
  5,000 files? (State in frontmatter -> agent must read frontmatter
  of each file, or use INDEX.md)
- Should INDEX.md list items by state? That would let the agent find
  active items without scanning every file.
- When does `processkit sync` become necessary vs optional?
- Is archiving aggressive enough? (3,500 done items still on disk is
  wasteful)

---

### Scenario 10: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Spins Up a Project

**Persona:** Multi-agent orchestration system

**User Story:**
> As a multi-agent orchestrator, I want to programmatically create a
> processkit project with a full team structure, so that I can
> coordinate a software development team working on a product.

**Preconditions:**
- Orchestrator has processkit CLI available
- Orchestrator has a product brief to implement
- Orchestrator needs to create: a project, 5 agent actors, roles,
  initial backlog

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator runs: `processkit init webapp --process full-product
   --non-interactive`
2. processkit creates the project with all primitives active
3. Orchestrator programmatically creates Actor entities for 5 agents:
   - Senior Developer (expertise: react, node)
   - Junior Developer (expertise: css, html)
   - QA Engineer (expertise: testing, automation)
   - Product Owner (expertise: product-strategy, ux)
   - Tech Lead (expertise: architecture, system-design)
4. Orchestrator creates Role entities: Developer, QA, PO, Tech Lead
5. Orchestrator assigns actors to roles
6. Orchestrator creates a Scope entity for "v1.0 Launch"
7. Orchestrator creates 20 initial work items from the product brief
8. Orchestrator creates process definitions (code-review, release)
   customized for this team
9. Orchestrator spawns agents and assigns them initial work items
10. Agents start working, logging events, making decisions, following
    processes

**Validation questions:**
- Can all of this be done non-interactively via CLI commands?
- Does `processkit id generate` work in batch mode for creating many
  entities?
- Is the file-per-entity format efficient for programmatic bulk
  creation?
- How does the orchestrator monitor progress across the project?
  (Read event log? Metrics?)

---

## 3. Coverage Analysis

### Which primitives are exercised by each scenario?

| Primitive | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | S7 | S8 | S9 | S10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Work Item | x | x | x | x | x | | | x | x | x |
| Event | x | x | | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |
| Decision | | | | x | | x | | | | x |
| Artifact | | | | | | | | | | |
| Actor | x | | | | x | | | | | x |
| Role | x | | | | x | | | | | x |
| Process | | | | | x | | | | | x |
| State Machine | | x | | x | | | | | | |
| Category | | x | | | | | | | | x |
| Cross-Reference | | | | | | x | | | | x |
| Gate | | | | | x | | | | | x |
| Metric | | | | | | | | | x | x |
| Schedule | | | | | | | x | | | |
| Scope | | | | | | | | | | x |
| Constraint | | | | | x | | | | | |
| Context | x | | | x | | | | x | | |
| Discussion | | | | | | x | | | | |

### Gaps identified:
- **Artifact** is not exercised by any scenario — need a scenario
  for research output or build/release tracking
- **Schedule** is only in scenario 7 — could add to scenario 10
  (orchestrator sets up cadences)
- **Constraint** only in scenario 5 (RBAC) — could add WIP limit
  scenario
