# Skills Quality Audit — March 2026

**Audited:** 85 SKILL.md files in `templates/skills/`
**Sample read in detail:** 22 files across all categories
**Date:** 2026-03-26

---

## Executive Summary

The skill library is **consistently structured and readable**, but
exhibits a clear two-tier quality split. Approximately 45% of skills
(the "deep" tier) follow all best practices with detailed reference
sections, code examples, and well-scoped tool permissions. The
remaining 55% (the "thin" tier) are serviceable but lack depth —
typically under 45 lines, with no code examples and no
`allowed-tools` declarations.

No skills define a `tools:` YAML frontmatter key. The correct field
in use is `allowed-tools:`, which 38 of 85 skills (45%) declare.
Zero skills use `tools:`.

---

## Methodology

Each skill was evaluated on five criteria:

| # | Criterion | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Structure** | Three-level rule: intro paragraph, overview section, detailed reference |
| 2 | **Examples** | Concrete code examples or command snippets (code blocks) |
| 3 | **Tools section** | `allowed-tools:` declared in YAML frontmatter |
| 4 | **Trigger description** | Specific enough that an agent knows when to activate |
| 5 | **Length** | Between 20 and 200 lines (not too thin, not overwhelming) |

Quantitative data was gathered across all 85 files; qualitative
assessment was based on a detailed reading of 22 representative
files.

---

## Quantitative Findings

### Code Examples (code blocks present)

- **39 of 85 (46%)** contain at least one fenced code block
- **46 of 85 (54%)** have zero code blocks

### allowed-tools Declaration

- **38 of 85 (45%)** declare `allowed-tools:` in frontmatter
- **47 of 85 (55%)** omit it entirely
- **0 of 85** use a `tools:` key

### YAML Frontmatter

- **85 of 85 (100%)** have valid YAML frontmatter with `name:` and
  `description:`
- All descriptions include a "Use when..." trigger clause (100%)

### Structure (three-level rule)

Based on the sample:

- **~40% fully follow** the three-level rule (intro paragraph +
  overview/when-to-use + detailed reference sections with
  subsections)
- **~45% partially follow** (have "When to Use" and "Instructions"
  but Instructions is a flat numbered list, not a multi-section
  reference)
- **~15% are minimal** (fewer than 25 lines, bullet-list-only
  instructions)

### Length Distribution

| Range | Count | Percentage | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| < 20 lines | 0 | 0% | -- |
| 20-45 lines | 17 | 20% | Thin — likely incomplete |
| 46-100 lines | 32 | 38% | Adequate for simple topics |
| 101-200 lines | 30 | 35% | Good depth |
| > 200 lines | 6 | 7% | Risk of context overload |

**Thinnest skills (under 25 lines):** backlog-context (18),
standup-context (21), decisions-adr (21), context-archiving (22).

**Longest skills (over 200 lines):** shell-scripting (245),
container-orchestration (208), auth-patterns (192 — close to
threshold), terraform-basics (182 — close).

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: No Code Examples (54% of skills)

The majority of skills rely entirely on prose instructions and
conversational "User/Agent" example pairs. While the conversational
examples show intent, they do not give the agent concrete patterns
to follow.

**Affected examples:** python-best-practices, rust-conventions,
debugging, testing-strategy, code-review, git-workflow,
release-semver, documentation, dependency-audit, dockerfile-review,
retrospective, estimation-planning

**Impact:** An agent activating these skills has guidance on *what
to do* but not *how it should look*. For code-centric skills
(python-best-practices, rust-conventions) this is a significant
gap.

### Issue 2: Missing allowed-tools (55% of skills)

Skills that perform actions (file reads, command execution) should
declare `allowed-tools:` so the agent gets appropriate permissions.
Many skills that clearly need tool access lack this declaration.

**Examples of skills that should have allowed-tools but do not:**
- `python-best-practices` — needs Bash(python:*), Bash(ruff:*),
  Read, Write
- `rust-conventions` — needs Bash(cargo:*), Read, Write
- `debugging` — needs Bash, Read
- `git-workflow` — needs Bash(git:*), Read
- `dockerfile-review` — needs Read, Write (at minimum)
- `dependency-audit` — needs Bash, Read
- `code-review` — needs Read

### Issue 3: Thin Process Skills

The three thinnest context-management skills are stubs: 18-21
lines, flat bullet lists, no examples of the actual file format
they manage, and no error handling guidance. They contrast sharply
with `session-handover` (97 lines) and `context-archiving`
(22 lines), which manage similar concerns.

**Specific gaps:**
- `backlog-context` (18 lines) — does not show the table format,
  does not explain ID assignment, does not handle edge cases
  (duplicate IDs, moving items between sections)
- `standup-context` (21 lines) — does not show the entry format
- `decisions-adr` (21 lines) — does not show the full decision
  record format or the inverse-chronological ordering rule

### Issue 4: Trigger Descriptions Could Be Pushier

Per Anthropic research, agents undertrigger — descriptions should
be "a little pushy" so the agent activates the skill even when the
user does not explicitly ask for it. Most descriptions are adequate
but passive. They describe what the skill does rather than asserting
when it should fire.

**Weak trigger examples:**
- `backlog-context`: "Manages project backlog as a file in the
  context directory" — agent must infer this applies when a user
  mentions a task or work item
- `standup-context`: "Manages session standup notes" — does not
  mention session start/end, progress recording
- `git-workflow`: "Use when the user needs guidance on git
  practices" — too deferential; should fire whenever the agent
  creates branches or commits
- `documentation`: "Use when creating or improving project
  documentation" — should also fire when adding new public
  functions without doc comments

**Strong trigger examples (models to follow):**
- `session-handover`: Lists specific trigger phrases and proactive
  trigger condition
- `debugging`: Good range of trigger phrases
- `incident-response`: "Use when something is broken in
  production" — clear urgency

### Issue 5: Inconsistent Depth Across Categories

Skills covering similar complexity levels have wildly different
depths:

| Comparison | Lines | Code blocks |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| auth-patterns | 192 | 14 |
| secret-management | ~45 | 0 |
| | | |
| shell-scripting | 245 | 30 |
| python-best-practices | 40 | 0 |
| rust-conventions | 39 | 0 |
| | | |
| container-orchestration | 208 | 22 |
| dockerfile-review | 45 | 2 |
| | | |
| rag-engineering | 125 | 0 |
| prompt-engineering | 133 | 2 |
| embedding-vectordb | ~90 | 0 |

## Category-by-Category Summary

### Language Conventions (6 skills)
`python-best-practices`, `rust-conventions`, `typescript-patterns`,
`go-conventions`, `java-patterns`, `shell-scripting`

**Quality:** Mixed. `shell-scripting` is exemplary (245 lines, 30
code blocks, allowed-tools). The rest are thin (35-45 lines) with
minimal or no code examples. `typescript-patterns` has one inline
code snippet, which is a modest improvement.

**Recommendation:** Expand all language skills to match
`shell-scripting` depth. Each should include: project setup snippet,
idiomatic error handling, testing example, and linting/formatting
commands.

### AI/ML (8 skills)
`ai-fundamentals`, `prompt-engineering`, `rag-engineering`,
`llm-evaluation`, `embedding-vectordb`, `ml-pipeline`,
`feature-engineering`, `agent-management`

**Quality:** Good. Most are 80-130 lines with structured
subsections. `rag-engineering` and `prompt-engineering` are strong.
`ai-fundamentals` and `agent-management` are well-structured. Most
have `allowed-tools` where needed.

**Recommendation:** Add code examples to `rag-engineering` (Python
snippets for chunking/embedding would be high-value). Add
`allowed-tools` to `agent-management`.

### Data (7 skills)
`data-science`, `data-pipeline`, `data-quality`,
`data-visualization`, `pandas-polars`, `feature-engineering`,
`sql-patterns`, `sql-style-guide`, `nosql-patterns`

**Quality:** Above average. `data-science` is exemplary (114 lines,
reference links, preferred-libraries table). Most have
`allowed-tools`. `sql-style-guide` and `nosql-patterns` have good
code blocks.

**Recommendation:** Minor — add code examples to `data-pipeline`
and `data-quality`.

### DevOps/Infrastructure (10 skills)
`ci-cd-setup`, `container-orchestration`, `dockerfile-review`,
`kubernetes-basics`, `terraform-basics`, `linux-administration`,
`dns-networking`, `secret-management`, `alerting-oncall`,
`distributed-tracing`

**Quality:** Strong for the detailed skills
(`container-orchestration`, `terraform-basics`,
`kubernetes-basics`, `linux-administration`). Weaker for
`ci-cd-setup`, `secret-management`, `alerting-oncall` which lack
code examples.

**Recommendation:** Expand `secret-management` (high-stakes topic
deserves more than ~45 lines). Add CI config examples to
`ci-cd-setup`.

### Process/Context Management (7 skills)
`backlog-context`, `standup-context`, `decisions-adr`,
`context-archiving`, `session-handover`, `release-semver`,
`retrospective`

**Quality:** Bimodal. `session-handover` is excellent (97 lines,
concrete template, clear triggers). The rest are stubs (18-45
lines).

**Recommendation:** All process skills should include the actual
file format template they manage, with a filled example. These
skills are activated frequently and shallow instructions lead to
inconsistent output.

### Design/Creative (4 skills)
`excalidraw`, `infographics`, `logo-design`, `frontend-design`

**Quality:** Consistently good. All are 100+ lines with structured
subsections, color palettes, and decision tables. `excalidraw`
includes JSON schema detail.

**Recommendation:** These are models for other categories.

### Software Engineering Practices (12 skills)
`code-review`, `testing-strategy`, `tdd-workflow`, `debugging`,
`refactoring`, `error-handling`, `concurrency-patterns`,
`performance-profiling`, `integration-testing`,
`software-architecture`, `system-design`, `domain-driven-design`

**Quality:** Mixed. `software-architecture` (132 lines, Mermaid
examples) and `estimation-planning` (110 lines) are strong.
`testing-strategy`, `debugging`, `code-review` are adequate but
brief (35-45 lines).

**Recommendation:** `code-review` should include a more concrete
checklist with example findings per language. `debugging` should
include diagnostic command examples.

### API/Protocol (6 skills)
`api-design`, `graphql-patterns`, `grpc-protobuf`,
`webhook-integration`, `auth-patterns`, `fastapi-patterns`

**Quality:** Good. All have code examples and most have
`allowed-tools`. `auth-patterns` is the deepest at 192 lines.

**Recommendation:** These are generally well-done. Minor: add
`allowed-tools` to any missing.

## Trigger Description Improvement Recommendations

Current descriptions follow the pattern: *"[Topic summary]. Use
when [condition]."* This is functional but passive. Recommended
improvements:

### Principle: Describe the trigger, not just the capability

**Before (passive):**
> Manages project backlog as a file in the context directory.
> Creates, prioritizes, and tracks work items in Markdown format.

**After (pushy):**
> Manages the project backlog in the context directory. Activate
> whenever the user mentions a task, work item, feature, bug, or
> TODO — or when creating/completing work that should be tracked.
> Also activate proactively at session start to review open items.

### Specific rewrites for the weakest triggers

| Skill | Current | Recommended |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `backlog-context` | "Manages project backlog as a file..." | "Manages the project backlog. Activate when the user mentions tasks, work items, bugs, or TODOs. Also activate proactively when completing work to update status." |
| `standup-context` | "Manages session standup notes..." | "Records session progress. Activate at session start to log what is planned, at session end to log what was done, or when the user says 'standup', 'progress', or 'what did we do'." |
| `decisions-adr` | "Manages architectural decision records..." | "Records decisions. Activate whenever a non-trivial technical or process choice is made — do not wait for the user to ask. If the conversation includes 'let us go with X' or 'we decided', this skill applies." |
| `git-workflow` | "Use when the user needs guidance on git practices." | "Use when creating branches, writing commit messages, preparing PRs, or when the user asks about git conventions. Activate proactively when the agent is about to commit or create a branch." |
| `documentation` | "Use when creating or improving project documentation." | "Use when writing docs, adding READMEs, or when the agent creates new public functions/types that lack doc comments. Activate proactively after adding new public API surface." |
| `code-review` | "Use when reviewing PRs, diffs, or code changes before merging." | "Use when the user says 'review', 'check this', 'is this ready', or shares a diff/PR link. Also activate when the agent is about to submit code and should self-review first." |
| `debugging` | "Use when tracking down bugs, unexpected behavior, or test failures." | "Use when the user reports a bug, error message, unexpected output, test failure, or says 'this doesn't work', 'help me debug', 'why is this failing'. Also activate when a command the agent ran produces an error." |
| `secret-management` | "Use when dealing with API keys, passwords, tokens, or credentials." | "Use when code contains API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings — or when the user needs to configure secrets. Also activate proactively when reviewing code that may accidentally commit secrets." |
| `context-archiving` | "Manages context/archive/..." | "Moves completed items from active context files to archive. Activate when active context files grow large (>100 items), when closing a project phase, or when the user says 'archive', 'clean up context', or 'move done items'." |
| `release-semver` | "Use when preparing a new release." | "Use when the user says 'release', 'bump version', 'publish', 'tag', 'cut a release', or 'ship it'. Also activate when the changelog has unreleased entries and the user asks to deploy." |

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total skills | 85 |
| With code examples | 39 (46%) |
| With allowed-tools | 38 (45%) |
| With valid frontmatter | 85 (100%) |
| With "Use when" trigger | 85 (100%) |
| Follow three-level rule fully | ~34 (40%) |
| Follow three-level rule partially | ~38 (45%) |
| Minimal/stub | ~13 (15%) |
| Estimated "production ready" (all criteria met) | ~30 (35%) |

### Overall Assessment

The skill library has a strong foundation — consistent naming,
universal YAML frontmatter, and a clear structural pattern. The top
~35% of skills (auth-patterns, shell-scripting,
container-orchestration, terraform-basics, rag-engineering,
data-science, excalidraw, prompt-engineering, session-handover,
software-architecture, estimation-planning, logo-design,
infographics) are high quality and serve as models.

The primary improvement opportunity is lifting the bottom 55% to
match the top tier: adding code examples, declaring allowed-tools,
expanding stub process skills, and making trigger descriptions more
assertive. This would be a medium-effort task (estimated 2-3
focused sessions) with high impact on agent activation accuracy and
output quality.
