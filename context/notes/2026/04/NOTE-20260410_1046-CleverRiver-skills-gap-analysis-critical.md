---

## 4. Competitive Platform Comparison

### 4.1 Cursor Rules

Cursor uses `.cursorrules` files (system-message prompts) and an
official marketplace (Feb 2026) with partner integrations
(Amplitude, AWS, Figma). Common rule categories:

- **Code style and formatting** (nearly universal)
- **Programming paradigms** (functional/declarative preference)
- **AI behavior guidance** ("don't apologize, fix errors")
- **Framework-specific rules** (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte
  dominate)
- **Testing requirements** (mandatory CI, automated testing)

**processkit advantage:** Deeper, structured skills with reference
materials vs. Cursor's flat instruction files.
**processkit gap:** No AI behavior guidance skills; no
framework-specific skills for React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Django,
Rails, Express.

### 4.2 GitHub Copilot Skills

GitHub Copilot adopted the SKILL.md format. Skills stored in
`.github/skills/` (project) or `~/.copilot/skills/` (personal).
The `awesome-copilot` repository organizes skills by:

- Code quality and review
- Testing and CI/CD
- Documentation
- Security
- Architecture
- Language-specific patterns

**processkit advantage:** Significantly more skills with deeper
reference materials; covers more domains.
**processkit gap:** Copilot skills include GitHub-specific
integrations (Issues, PRs, Actions workflows) that processkit
lacks.

### 4.3 Windsurf Rules

Windsurf uses `.windsurfrules` (global) and `.windsurf/rules/`
(workspace). Rules are pattern-matched to file types. Total limit:
12,000 characters combined.

**processkit advantage:** No character limit constraints;
progressive disclosure model is superior.
**processkit gap:** Windsurf's file-pattern matching (auto-activate
rules for `*.tsx` vs `*.py`) is a UX pattern processkit could
adopt.

### 4.4 Community Collections

| Repository | Skills | Notable Categories Not Covered |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------|
| VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills | 1,000+ | Browser automation, web scraping, social media, legal workflows, video processing |
| awesome-claude-skills (multiple) | 500+ | Memory management, context optimization, file/document processing, Firecrawl web access |
| OpenClaw/ClawHub | 13,700+ | Music generation, materials simulation, VMware operations, product development |
| SkillsMP | 97,000+ | Heavily frontend-skewed; 46% duplicates per HuggingFace analysis |

---

## 5. Most Popular Skills in the Ecosystem (by installs, March 2026)

| Skill | Installs | Category | In processkit? |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| find-skills (meta-discovery) | 418,600 | Meta | No (N/A) |
| vercel-react-best-practices | 176,400 | Framework | **No** |
| web-design-guidelines | 137,000 | Design | Partial |
| remotion-best-practices | 126,000 | Media/Video | **No** |
| frontend-design (Anthropic) | 124,100-277,000 | Design | Yes (similar) |
| firecrawl (web data access) | High | Integration | **No** |
| agent-browser (browser control) | High | Automation | **No** |
| shannon (pen testing) | Growing | Security | **No** |

**Key insight:** Frontend/React skills dominate installs.
Infrastructure, data, and security skills are vastly
underrepresented in the ecosystem but are high-demand gaps —
exactly where processkit already has strength.

## 9. Prioritized Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Immediate (addresses critical gaps)
1. **react-patterns** — Highest ecosystem demand signal (176K+
   installs for similar skills)
2. **nextjs-patterns** — Tightly coupled with React; App Router is
   the dominant paradigm
3. **cloud-aws** — Most-used cloud; no cloud coverage is a
   significant blind spot
4. **codebase-migration** — Top delegated task with zero coverage

### Phase 2 — Near-term (high strategic value)
5. **accessibility-wcag** — Regulatory pressure and ethical
   imperative; standalone skill warranted
6. **monorepo-management** — AI is accelerating monorepo adoption;
   growing need
7. **browser-automation** — Fastest-growing agent capability
   category
8. **django-patterns** — Fills Python backend gap alongside
   fastapi-patterns
9. **express-node-patterns** — Fills JavaScript/TypeScript backend
   gap

### Phase 3 — Medium-term (round out coverage)
10. **cloud-gcp** + **cloud-azure** — Complete cloud trifecta
11. **i18n-l10n** — Commonly needed, no good skills exist anywhere
12. **regex-patterns** — High delegation rate, low effort to create
13. **vue-patterns** + **svelte-patterns** — Framework breadth
14. **ai-agent-development** — Strategic for an AI-focused tool
15. **environment-setup** — Developer onboarding is a pain point

### Phase 4 — Long-term (completeness)
16-27. Remaining skills from sections 7.3 and 7.4 based on user
feedback.

## 10. Strategic Observations

### 10.1 Strengths vs. Ecosystem

- **Quality over quantity:** Curated skills with reference materials
  vs. 97,000+ marketplace skills where 46% are duplicates and 80%
  are "slop." This is a core differentiator.
- **Deep infrastructure/backend coverage:** 10 infrastructure + 4
  architecture + 4 database skills are better than most marketplace
  offerings. The ecosystem skews heavily frontend.
- **AI/ML depth:** 6 AI/ML skills with reference materials (RAG
  engineering, embedding/vectordb, ml-pipeline) are best-in-class
  for a curated collection.
- **Process skills:** 9 process skills (backlog, ADR, standup,
  retro, incident response, agent management) are unique — almost
  no marketplace skills address team process.

### 10.2 Weaknesses vs. Ecosystem

- **No cloud provider skills:** This is the single largest gap.
  AWS/GCP/Azure are fundamental to modern development and heavily
  represented in competing collections.
- **Framework coverage is narrow:** Only 5 framework skills
  (fastapi, reflex, pandas-polars, flutter, seo). The top 10
  most-installed marketplace skills are all framework-specific
  (React, Next.js, Vue).
- **No browser/web automation:** Browser Use and Playwright-based
  skills are the fastest-growing category in 2026. This is an
  emergent gap.
- **Missing popular languages:** C#/.NET, Swift, and Kotlin have
  significant developer populations with no coverage.

### 10.3 Ecosystem Trends to Watch

1. **Skill composability:** Skills referencing other skills and MCP
   servers for tool access.
2. **Process enforcement skills:** Skills that change how agents
   work, not just what they know (brainstorming before coding,
   mandatory test plans).
3. **Vision-based skills:** Using VLMs for UI review, accessibility
   auditing, design-to-code.
4. **Context management skills:** Memory, session handover, context
   window optimization.
5. **Security scanning skills:** Autonomous pen testing and
   vulnerability analysis (Shannon skill).
