# Process Ontology: Universal Primitives Across All Domains

**Status:** Research complete
**Date:** 2026-03-26
**Author:** Researcher agent

---

## 1. Introduction and Methodology

This document identifies the **universal process primitives** -- the
fundamental building blocks that ALL process frameworks share, regardless
of domain. These are the atoms from which every process in every
industry is composed.

**Why this matters for processkit:** processkit provides base processes
for managing projects. Higher-level applications (multi-agent
orchestrators, domain-specific tools) compose these primitives into
specific frameworks. If processkit gets the primitives right, it can
support any domain -- software, manufacturing, healthcare, legal, supply
chain, research, and beyond.

**Methodology:**
1. Analyzed four IT/project management frameworks from our existing
   research (SAFe 6.0, PMBOK 7th, CMMI v3.0, IPMA ICB4)
2. Cross-referenced against manufacturing (Toyota Production System,
   Lean, Six Sigma), healthcare (clinical pathways), legal (case
   management), supply chain (order management), knowledge management
   (Zettelkasten, PARA, GTD), issue trackers (GitHub Issues, Linear,
   Jira, Asana), Shape Up (Basecamp), Kanban, ITIL v4, BPMN 2.0,
   systems thinking, and quality management (ISO 9001, TQM)
3. Extracted common structural patterns that appear in 3+ unrelated
   domains
4. Validated against the starting hypothesis of 13 primitives --
   refined to 15

**Key finding:** The 13 hypothesized primitives are largely correct but
needed refinement. Two additional primitives emerged (Constraint and
Context/Environment), and several were sharpened based on cross-domain
analysis. The primitives form a coherent ontology with well-defined
relationships.

## 2. The 15 Universal Process Primitives

### 2.1 Primitive: Work Item

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Story, Feature, Capability, Epic
- PMBOK: Work Package, Activity, Task
- Kanban: Card
- Shape Up: Scope, Pitch
- ITIL: Incident, Problem, Change Request, Service Request
- Healthcare: Order (lab order, medication order), Referral, Care Task
- Legal: Case, Matter, Action Item, Filing
- Manufacturing: Work Order, Job, Production Order, Kanban Card
- Supply Chain: Purchase Order, Shipment, Fulfillment Request
- GTD: Next Action, Project
- Zettelkasten: (not applicable -- Zettelkasten has no work items,
  only notes)
- BPMN: Task (User Task, Service Task, Manual Task)
- Six Sigma: CTQ (Critical to Quality) requirement, Improvement Action
- GitHub/Jira/Linear: Issue, Ticket, Story, Bug, Task

**Definition:** A discrete unit of work that must be performed, tracked,
and completed. The most fundamental primitive -- every process framework
has some notion of "a thing to be done."

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `title` | string | Human-readable short description |
| `description` | text | Detailed explanation of what needs to be done |
| `state` | enum | Current lifecycle state (see State Machine primitive) |
| `owner` | reference(Role) | Who is responsible for completion |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the item was created |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | When it was last modified |
| `priority` | reference(Category) | How urgent/important this is |
| `parent` | reference(Work Item) | Optional hierarchical parent |
| `references` | reference(Cross-reference)[] | Links to other items |

**State machine (universal lifecycle):**
```
Draft/New --> Ready/Accepted --> In Progress --> In Review --> Done/Closed
                                    |                           |
                                    +--> Blocked                |
                                    +--> Cancelled/Withdrawn ---+
```

Every framework uses a subset or elaboration of this pattern. SAFe adds
"Funnel -> Reviewing -> Analyzing" for epics. ITIL adds "Awaiting User
Info" and "Known Error." Healthcare adds "Ordered -> Scheduled ->
Performed -> Resulted." But the core shape is always: not-started ->
active -> completed, with escape states for blocked/cancelled.

**Relationships:**
- **parent-child** with other Work Items (epic -> feature -> story ->
  task)
- **blocks/blocked-by** other Work Items
- **assigned-to** a Role
- **belongs-to** a Scope/Container
- **governed-by** a Process/Workflow
- **measured-by** Metrics
- **produces** Artifacts
- **validated-at** Checkpoints/Gates

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Name | Hierarchy | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | Epic/Feature/Story | 4 levels (Portfolio->Solution->ART->Team) | Fixed hierarchy depth, PI-bounded |
| PMBOK 7th | Work Package/Activity | WBS decomposition, variable depth | Scope-driven, can be predictive or adaptive |
| Kanban | Card | Flat (or minimal grouping) | No prescribed hierarchy, flow-focused |
| ITIL v4 | Incident/Change/Problem | Type-driven, not hierarchy-driven | Classified by nature (break-fix vs. planned change) |
| Manufacturing (TPS) | Kanban Card / Work Order | Station -> Line -> Plant | Physical flow through workstations |
| Healthcare | Clinical Order | Order Set -> Individual Order | Protocol-driven, safety-critical |
| Legal | Case / Matter | Matter -> Tasks -> Filings | Jurisdiction and statute-driven |
| GTD | Next Action / Project | Project -> Next Actions | Context-tagged, energy-level-tagged |
| Shape Up | Pitch / Scope | Pitch -> Scopes -> Tasks | Fixed-time (6-week cycle), variable scope |

**processkit implication:** The Work Item is the core trackable entity.
The universal model validates this. processkit should support:
(1) hierarchical parent-child relationships, (2) a configurable state
machine per work item type, (3) cross-references between items. A flat
backlog table is sufficient for small projects but should allow optional
nesting.

### 2.2 Primitive: Log Entry / Event

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: PI System Demo outcome, I&A finding
- PMBOK: Lessons learned, Issue log entry, Risk register entry
- ITIL: Incident record, Audit trail entry, Event record
- Healthcare: Clinical note, Progress note, Audit log entry, Vital sign
  reading
- Legal: Case note, Docket entry, Court filing record, Billing entry
- Manufacturing: Production log entry, Quality inspection record,
  Defect report
- Supply Chain: Tracking event (shipped, in-transit, delivered),
  Customs entry
- GTD: Weekly review note, Capture inbox item
- BPMN: Event (Start, Intermediate, End), Signal, Message
- Systems Thinking: Stock measurement at a point in time
- Kanban: Cumulative flow diagram data point
- Six Sigma: Measurement data point, Control chart reading
- ISO 9001: Audit finding, Nonconformity record

**Definition:** An immutable record of something that happened at a
specific point in time. The fundamental unit of history and
accountability. Events are append-only -- you never modify a past event,
you create a new event that supersedes or corrects it.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `timestamp` | timestamp | When the event occurred |
| `type` | enum | Classification of the event |
| `actor` | reference(Role) | Who/what caused the event |
| `subject` | reference(any) | What the event is about |
| `description` | text | Human-readable description |
| `data` | structured | Event-specific payload |
| `source` | string | System or process that generated the event |

**State machine:** Events are immutable -- they have no lifecycle. They
exist or they don't. (Though they can be soft-deleted or retracted by a
subsequent event.)

**Relationships:**
- **about** a Work Item, Artifact, or any other primitive
- **caused-by** another Event (event chains / causal sequences)
- **triggers** a Process/Workflow or state transition
- **aggregated-into** Metrics
- **recorded-within** a Scope/Container

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Name | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | Flow metric data point, PI event | Aggregated into flow velocity, time, efficiency |
| PMBOK 7th | Issue log entry, Lessons learned | Feeds measurement performance domain |
| ITIL v4 | Event record, Incident record | Triggers incident/problem management workflows |
| Manufacturing | Production log, SPC data point | Feeds control charts and process capability |
| Healthcare | Clinical observation, Vital sign | Time-series, legally mandated retention |
| Legal | Docket entry, Filing timestamp | Court-mandated, tamper-proof, chronological |
| Supply Chain | Tracking event (EDI 214/990) | Enables end-to-end visibility |

**processkit implication:** This primitive validates the event-sourced
architecture. Key insight: events should be typed (state-change,
comment, measurement, system-event) and always reference the subject
they describe. The materializer pattern (events -> aggregated metrics)
is universal across all domains.

---

### 2.3 Primitive: Decision Record

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Lean Business Case decision, PI Planning commitment
- PMBOK: Change request resolution, Lessons learned decision
- Software: Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- ITIL: Change Advisory Board (CAB) decision, Problem resolution
- Healthcare: Treatment decision, Clinical protocol selection,
  Informed consent
- Legal: Ruling, Verdict, Settlement agreement, Legal opinion
- Manufacturing: Engineering Change Notice (ECN), Process change
  approval
- Supply Chain: Vendor selection decision, Route optimization decision
- Government: Policy decision, Regulatory ruling
- GTD: "Someday/Maybe" triage decision
- ISO 9001: Management review output, Corrective action decision

**Definition:** A record of a choice made, including the context,
options considered, rationale, and consequences. Decisions are
first-class artifacts because they explain *why* things are the way
they are -- without decision records, institutional knowledge is lost.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `title` | string | What was decided |
| `status` | enum | Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded |
| `date` | date | When the decision was made |
| `context` | text | Situation requiring a decision |
| `decision` | text | What was decided and why |
| `alternatives` | text[] | Options considered and why rejected |
| `consequences` | text | Implications (positive, negative, risks) |
| `decision_makers` | reference(Role)[] | Who made the decision |
| `superseded_by` | reference(Decision Record) | If this decision was replaced |

**State machine:**
```
Proposed --> Accepted --> [Active]
                |
                +--> Deprecated
                +--> Superseded
```

**Relationships:**
- **affects** Work Items, Processes, Artifacts
- **supersedes** older Decision Records
- **justified-by** Events (data that informed the decision)
- **constrained-by** Constraints (regulations, budgets, etc.)
- **made-by** Roles
- **scoped-to** a Scope/Container

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Name | Formality Level |
|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | Lean Business Case | Formal -- requires cost-benefit analysis |
| PMBOK 7th | Change request disposition | Formal -- change control board approval |
| ITIL v4 | CAB decision | Formal -- advisory board with defined authority |
| Software (ADR) | Architecture Decision Record | Semi-formal -- lightweight markdown document |
| Healthcare | Treatment plan decision | Highly formal -- informed consent, legal liability |
| Legal | Court ruling | Maximum formality -- legally binding precedent |
| Manufacturing | ECN approval | Formal -- engineering review board |

**processkit implication:** This is well-aligned with the universal
pattern. Recommendation: add structured fields for `alternatives` and
`consequences` to make decisions more useful. The inverse-chronological
format is correct -- most recent decisions matter most.

---

### 2.4 Primitive: Artifact

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Deliverable, Documentation, Solution
- PMBOK: Deliverable, Work product, Baseline document
- ITIL: Configuration Item (CI), Knowledge article, Service
  documentation
- Healthcare: Test result, Radiology image, Pathology report,
  Prescription
- Legal: Brief, Contract, Motion, Exhibit, Transcript, Filing
- Manufacturing: Bill of Materials (BOM), Technical drawing, Product,
  Assembly
- Supply Chain: Shipping document, Invoice, Packing list, Certificate
  of origin
- Software: Code, Build, Binary, Release, Documentation, API spec
- Research: Paper, Dataset, Model, Notebook
- BPMN: Data Object, Data Store
- ISO 9001: Documented information (the ISO term for any artifact)

**Definition:** Any tangible output produced or consumed by a process.
Artifacts are the "nouns" that processes create, transform, and
deliver. They have versions and may require approval before use.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name |
| `type` | enum | Classification (document, code, build, report, etc.) |
| `version` | string | Current version (semantic or sequential) |
| `state` | enum | Draft, Review, Approved, Published, Archived, Superseded |
| `author` | reference(Role) | Who created it |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When it was created |
| `location` | URI | Where it is stored |
| `format` | string | File format or media type |

**State machine:**
```
Draft --> In Review --> Approved --> Published --> Archived
                |                                    |
                +--> Rejected (back to Draft)         |
                                                     +--> Superseded
```

**Relationships:**
- **produced-by** Work Items or Processes
- **consumed-by** Work Items or Processes
- **versioned-as** a sequence of Artifacts (version chain)
- **approved-at** a Checkpoint/Gate
- **classified-by** Categories
- **stored-in** a Scope/Container

**processkit implication:** Artifacts are files in the context directory
and generated outputs. The `templates/` directory defines artifact
templates. processkit should treat all context files as typed artifacts
with implicit versioning through git. The process template system
produces artifacts from templates.

---

### 2.5 Primitive: Role

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Release Train Engineer, Epic
  Owner
- PMBOK: Project Manager, Sponsor, Team Member, Stakeholder
- RACI: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
- ITIL: Service Owner, Incident Manager, Change Manager, Problem
  Manager
- Healthcare: Physician, Nurse, Pharmacist, Patient, Attending,
  Resident
- Legal: Attorney, Judge, Plaintiff, Defendant, Paralegal, Expert
  Witness
- Manufacturing: Operator, Inspector, Supervisor, Process Engineer
- Supply Chain: Buyer, Supplier, Carrier, Warehouse Manager, Customs
  Broker
- Kanban: (minimal -- typically just team member)
- ISO 9001: Top management, Process owner, Internal auditor

**Definition:** A named set of responsibilities, permissions, and
expectations. Roles are not people -- they are hats that people (or
agents) wear. One person can hold multiple roles; one role can be
filled by multiple people.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Role name |
| `description` | text | What this role is responsible for |
| `permissions` | string[] | What this role is allowed to do |
| `responsibilities` | string[] | What this role must do |
| `filled_by` | reference(Actor)[] | Current holders of this role |
| `reports_to` | reference(Role) | Hierarchical superior role |

**State machine:** Roles themselves are static definitions. Role
*assignments* have a lifecycle:
```
Proposed --> Active --> Suspended --> Revoked
```

**Relationships:**
- **assigned-to** Work Items (as owner, reviewer, approver)
- **participates-in** Processes
- **responsible-for** Artifacts
- **makes** Decisions
- **member-of** a Scope/Container (team, department)
- **has-authority** over Checkpoints/Gates

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Key Roles | Distinguishing Feature |
|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | PO, SM, RTE, Epic Owner, Architect | Role per hierarchy level |
| PMBOK 7th | PM, Sponsor, Team, Stakeholder | Stakeholder-centric, PM is integrator |
| ITIL v4 | Service Owner, Process Manager, CAB Chair | Service-oriented role structure |
| Healthcare | Attending, Resident, Nurse, Pharmacist | Legally defined scope of practice |
| Legal | Attorney of Record, Judge, Clerk | Jurisdictionally defined authority |
| RACI | R, A, C, I | Not roles per se but responsibility assignments |

**processkit implication:** processkit should support: (1) role
definitions separate from person/agent assignments, (2) RACI-style
responsibility mapping per process step, (3) role hierarchies for
escalation.

---

### 2.6 Primitive: Process / Workflow

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: PI cadence, Inspect & Adapt ceremony, Portfolio Kanban flow
- PMBOK: Process group, Performance domain activities
- CMMI: Practice Area, Process Area
- ITIL: Practice (Incident Management, Change Enablement, etc.)
- Healthcare: Clinical pathway, Care protocol, Standard operating
  procedure
- Legal: Litigation process, Contract review process, Discovery
  procedure
- Manufacturing: Standard work, Production process, Assembly procedure
- Supply Chain: Order-to-cash, Procure-to-pay, Plan-to-produce
- BPMN: Process (the top-level container of activities, events,
  gateways)
- GTD: The 5-step workflow (Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect,
  Engage)
- Six Sigma: DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)
- ISO 9001: Documented procedure, Quality management process
- Shape Up: The Shape Up cycle (Shape, Bet, Build)

**Definition:** A defined sequence of steps, decision points, and rules
that transforms inputs into outputs. Processes are the "verbs" of the
ontology -- they describe *how* work gets done. Every process has a
trigger (what starts it), steps (what happens), decision points
(branches), and an end condition.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Process name |
| `version` | string | Semantic version |
| `purpose` | text | Why this process exists |
| `trigger` | reference(Event or Schedule) | What starts this process |
| `inputs` | reference(Artifact)[] | Required inputs |
| `outputs` | reference(Artifact)[] | Expected outputs |
| `steps` | Step[] | Ordered sequence of activities |
| `roles` | reference(Role)[] | Who participates |
| `gates` | reference(Checkpoint)[] | Quality checkpoints |
| `metrics` | reference(Metric)[] | How success is measured |
| `owner` | reference(Role) | Who maintains this process |

**State machine (process instance):**
```
Not Started --> In Progress --> Completed
                    |
                    +--> Suspended
                    +--> Aborted
                    +--> Failed (requires corrective action)
```

**Relationships:**
- **contains** Steps (which contain Work Items)
- **triggered-by** Events or Schedules
- **produces** Artifacts
- **governed-by** Constraints
- **validated-by** Checkpoints/Gates
- **measured-by** Metrics
- **performed-by** Roles
- **nested-within** other Processes (sub-processes)
- **tailored-from** a standard Process (CMMI concept)

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Process Example | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | PI Planning ceremony | Time-boxed, cadence-based, face-to-face |
| PMBOK 7th | (Performance domains, not prescriptive processes) | Principle-guided, tailored per project |
| ITIL v4 | Incident Management practice | Event-triggered, SLA-bound |
| DMAIC | Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control | Sequential phases, data-driven |
| Healthcare | Stroke clinical pathway | Time-critical, evidence-based, protocol-driven |
| Legal | Litigation lifecycle | Jurisdiction-bound, adversarial, statute-limited |
| Manufacturing (TPS) | Standard Work sequence | Takt-time-bounded, visual, station-level |
| BPMN | Any BPMN process diagram | Formal notation with events, tasks, gateways, flows |

**processkit implication:** processkit already has process templates
(bug-fix, code-review, feature-development, release). This primitive
validates that structure. Key additions: (1) every process should
declare its trigger condition, (2) processes should be composable (a
step in one process can invoke another process), (3) process instances
should be tracked in the event log.

---

### 2.7 Primitive: State Machine

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Portfolio Kanban states, Story lifecycle
- PMBOK: Project phase gates
- ITIL: Incident lifecycle states, Change lifecycle states
- Healthcare: Patient status (admitted, discharged, transferred),
  Order status
- Legal: Case status (filed, discovery, trial, appeal, closed)
- Manufacturing: Production stage (raw, WIP, finished, shipped)
- Supply Chain: Order status (placed, confirmed, shipped, delivered,
  returned)
- Kanban: Board columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- BPMN: Sequence flow between activities (implicit state machine)
- Software: Git branch states, CI pipeline stages, deployment stages
- Issue trackers: Status field (Open, In Progress, In Review, Closed)

**Definition:** A formal definition of the allowed states an entity can
be in and the allowed transitions between those states. State machines
are not entities themselves -- they are *definitions* that govern the
lifecycle of other primitives (primarily Work Items, Artifacts, and
Process instances).

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | What this state machine governs |
| `states` | State[] | All possible states |
| `initial_state` | reference(State) | Starting state |
| `terminal_states` | reference(State)[] | End states |
| `transitions` | Transition[] | Allowed state changes |
| `guards` | Condition[] | Conditions that must be true for a transition |

Each **State** has: `name`, `description`, `is_terminal` (boolean),
`entry_actions` (what happens when entering), `exit_actions` (what
happens when leaving).

Each **Transition** has: `from_state`, `to_state`, `trigger` (what
causes it), `guard` (condition), `action` (side effect).

**The Universal State Pattern:** Across all domains studied, state
machines share a common meta-pattern:

```
[Backlog/Queue] --> [Active/In-Progress] --> [Validation/Review] --> [Terminal/Done]
       |                    |                       |
       |                    +--> [Blocked/Waiting]  +--> [Rejected] --> [Active]
       |                    +--> [Cancelled]
       +--> [Deferred/Someday]
```

This pattern holds for:
- Software tickets: Backlog -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done
- Manufacturing orders: Queued -> In Production -> QC Inspection ->
  Shipped
- Healthcare orders: Ordered -> In Progress -> Resulted -> Verified
- Legal cases: Filed -> Active -> Trial/Hearing -> Decided/Settled
- Supply chain shipments: Created -> In Transit -> Customs -> Delivered

**processkit implication:** processkit should define state machines as
first-class configuration objects, not hard-coded enums. Each work item
type (task, bug, feature, epic) could have a different state machine.
The state machine definition should be declarative (YAML or similar)
and referenced by work item types. This enables domain customization
without code changes.

---

### 2.8 Primitive: Category / Taxonomy

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Work type (feature, enabler, defect, debt), PI classification
- PMBOK: Risk category, Stakeholder category, Change type
- ITIL: Incident category, Service category, Priority matrix
- Healthcare: ICD-10 diagnosis code, CPT procedure code, Triage level
- Legal: Case type (civil, criminal, family), Practice area,
  Jurisdiction
- Manufacturing: Product category, Defect type, Material
  classification
- Supply Chain: SKU category, Shipping class, Hazmat classification
- GTD: Context (@phone, @computer, @office), Energy level, Time
  available
- Kanban: Swim lane classification, Class of service (expedite,
  standard, etc.)
- GitHub/Jira: Label, Component, Issue Type, Priority, Severity
- Six Sigma: Defect category (from Pareto analysis)
- ISO 9001: Nonconformity type, Audit finding category

**Definition:** A system for classifying and organizing entities into
groups based on shared characteristics. Taxonomies impose order on
complexity and enable filtering, routing, reporting, and
prioritization.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Category name |
| `type` | string | What dimension this categorizes (priority, type, area, etc.) |
| `values` | Value[] | Allowed values (ordered or unordered) |
| `hierarchical` | boolean | Whether values form a tree |
| `exclusive` | boolean | Whether an entity can have only one value from this category |
| `default_value` | reference(Value) | Default if unspecified |

**Common category dimensions across all domains:**
1. **Priority/Urgency:** How soon must this be addressed?
   (Critical/High/Medium/Low or P0-P4)
2. **Type/Nature:** What kind of thing is this?
   (Feature/Bug/Chore or Incident/Problem/Change)
3. **Area/Domain:** What part of the system/organization does this
   belong to? (Backend/Frontend or Cardiology/Orthopedics)
4. **Size/Effort:** How big is this? (XS/S/M/L/XL or story points
   or t-shirt sizes)
5. **Risk/Impact:** What happens if this goes wrong?
   (Critical/Major/Minor/Cosmetic)

**Relationships:**
- **classifies** Work Items, Artifacts, Events, and most other
  primitives
- **organized-within** a Scope/Container
- **used-by** Processes (for routing, filtering, prioritization)
- **measured-by** Metrics (distribution across categories)

**processkit implication:** processkit should support: (1) user-defined
category dimensions, (2) both flat and hierarchical taxonomies, (3)
both exclusive (one priority) and non-exclusive (many labels)
categories. The existing tag system in process document frontmatter is
a good start.

### 2.9 Primitive: Cross-Reference / Relation

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Dependency (on Program Board), Feature-to-Story link
- PMBOK: Dependency (FS, FF, SS, SF), Traceability link
- ITIL: CI relationship, Incident-to-Problem link, Known Error
  reference
- Healthcare: Referral link, Lab order to result link, Medication
  interaction
- Legal: Case citation, Precedent reference, Cross-motion reference
- Manufacturing: BOM component link, Drawing reference, ECN
  cross-reference
- Supply Chain: PO-to-Invoice link, Shipment-to-Order link
- Zettelkasten: Link between notes (the core mechanism)
- BPMN: Sequence Flow, Message Flow, Association
- GitHub: "References #123", "Fixes #456", PR-to-Issue link
- Systems Thinking: Causal link (reinforcing or balancing)

**Definition:** An explicit, typed connection between two entities.
Cross-references create the web of relationships that gives context
its meaning. Without references, every item exists in isolation.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier (often implicit) |
| `source` | reference(any) | The entity making the reference |
| `target` | reference(any) | The entity being referenced |
| `type` | enum | The nature of the relationship |
| `direction` | enum | Unidirectional or bidirectional |
| `strength` | enum | Required/Optional/Informational |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the link was created |

**Universal relationship types (appear in 3+ domains):**
1. **parent-child** (hierarchical containment): Epic->Feature,
   Matter->Task, Order->Line Item
2. **blocks/blocked-by** (dependency): Task A blocks Task B, Motion
   blocks Trial
3. **relates-to** (informational association): Issue relates to Issue,
   Note links to Note
4. **duplicates** (equivalence): Duplicate incident, Duplicate bug
5. **supersedes** (replacement): New decision supersedes old, New
   version supersedes old
6. **implements/implemented-by** (realization): Story implements
   Feature, Order fulfills Request
7. **caused-by/causes** (causal): Incident caused by Problem, Defect
   caused by Change
8. **references** (citation): ADR references Issue, Brief cites
   Precedent

**Relationships:**
- **connects** any two primitives in the ontology
- **typed-by** Categories (relationship type taxonomy)
- **tracked-in** Event log (link creation/deletion events)

**processkit implication:** processkit should: (1) support explicit
typed references in frontmatter or structured fields, (2) maintain a
reference index (which items link to what), (3) detect broken
references. The Zettelkasten insight is powerful: the value of notes
grows with the density of links between them.

### 2.10 Primitive: Checkpoint / Gate

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: PI boundary, Definition of Done, System Demo
- PMBOK: Phase gate, Quality checkpoint, Milestone (decision point)
- CMMI: Process appraisal, Maturity assessment
- ITIL: Change review, Release validation, Service acceptance
- Healthcare: Clinical decision point, Discharge criteria check,
  Surgical safety checklist
- Legal: Motion hearing, Summary judgment, Pre-trial conference
- Manufacturing: Quality inspection point, Go/No-Go decision, Final
  acceptance test
- Supply Chain: Goods receipt inspection, Customs clearance, Final
  delivery confirmation
- Six Sigma: Tollgate review (end of each DMAIC phase)
- ISO 9001: Internal audit, Management review, Supplier evaluation
- Shape Up: Betting table (deciding which pitches to bet on)

**Definition:** A designated point in a process where work is evaluated
against defined criteria before it can proceed. Gates enforce quality,
compliance, and alignment. They are the mechanism by which
organizations ensure standards are met.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Gate name |
| `criteria` | Criterion[] | What must be true to pass |
| `authority` | reference(Role) | Who can approve passage |
| `severity` | enum | Blocking (must pass) or Advisory (may pass with waiver) |
| `automated` | boolean | Whether criteria are machine-checkable |
| `result` | enum | Passed, Failed, Waived |
| `evidence` | reference(Artifact)[] | What proves the criteria are met |
| `evaluated_at` | timestamp | When the gate was evaluated |

**State machine:**
```
Pending --> Evaluating --> Passed
                |
                +--> Failed --> Remediation --> Re-evaluation --> Passed
                +--> Waived (with justification)
```

**Relationships:**
- **validates** Work Items, Artifacts, Process instances
- **enforced-by** Processes
- **evaluated-by** Roles
- **produces** Events (pass/fail records)
- **requires** Artifacts (as evidence)
- **defined-within** a Scope/Container

**Cross-framework examples:**

| Framework | Gate Name | Blocking? | Automated? |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAFe 6.0 | Story DoD, Feature DoD | Yes | Partially (CI checks) |
| PMBOK 7th | Phase gate | Yes | No (human review) |
| Six Sigma | DMAIC tollgate | Yes | No |
| Manufacturing | Final QC inspection | Yes | Often (automated testing) |
| Healthcare | Surgical safety checklist (WHO) | Yes (life-critical) | No |
| Software CI | Pre-merge checks | Yes | Yes (fully automated) |
| ISO 9001 | Internal audit | Advisory | No |

**processkit implication:** Gates should be declarative (list of
criteria, each with pass/fail evaluation), gates can be automated (run
tests) or manual (require human sign-off), and gate results should be
logged as events. The existing Definition of Done pattern in process
templates maps directly.

### 2.11 Primitive: Metric / Measure

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Flow Metrics (velocity, time, efficiency, load, distribution,
  predictability)
- PMBOK: EVM indices (SPI, CPI), KPIs, Performance measures
- CMMI: Process performance baselines, Statistical process control
  measures
- ITIL: SLA metrics, Service level targets, Mean Time to Restore
  (MTTR)
- Healthcare: Clinical outcome measures, Patient satisfaction scores,
  Readmission rates
- Legal: Billable hours, Case resolution time, Win/loss rate
- Manufacturing: OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), Defect rate,
  Yield, Takt time
- Supply Chain: On-time delivery rate, Fill rate, Inventory turnover,
  Lead time
- Six Sigma: Sigma level, DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities),
  Cp/Cpk
- OKR: Key Result (measurable outcome)
- Kanban: Lead time, Cycle time, Throughput, WIP count
- Systems Thinking: Stock level, Flow rate

**Definition:** A quantified observation about a system, process, or
outcome. Metrics are derived from Events (aggregated over time) and
provide the feedback signal for improvement. Without metrics,
improvement is guesswork.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Metric name |
| `description` | text | What this metric measures and why it matters |
| `unit` | string | Unit of measurement (hours, count, percentage, etc.) |
| `formula` | expression | How to compute the value from raw data |
| `target` | number | Desired value or range |
| `threshold` | range | Acceptable range (green/yellow/red) |
| `frequency` | reference(Schedule) | How often it is computed |
| `source` | reference(Event type)[] | What events feed this metric |
| `current_value` | number | Most recent computed value |
| `trend` | enum | Improving, Stable, Degrading |

**State machine:** Metrics themselves don't have states. Metric
*values* are time-series data points (a stream of Events). But a
metric's *health* can be:
```
Within Target (Green) --> Approaching Threshold (Yellow) --> Breached (Red)
                                                                |
                                                                +--> Escalation triggered
```

**Relationships:**
- **measures** Work Items, Processes, Roles, Scopes
- **derived-from** Events (aggregation)
- **compared-against** targets and thresholds
- **reported-on** Schedules (cadence)
- **triggers** Processes (when thresholds are breached)
- **informs** Decisions

**The Universal Metric Categories:**
1. **Time metrics:** Lead time, cycle time, flow time, wait time,
   response time
2. **Volume metrics:** Throughput, velocity, count, inventory level
3. **Quality metrics:** Defect rate, pass rate, accuracy, sigma level
4. **Efficiency metrics:** Utilization, flow efficiency, yield, OEE
5. **Predictability metrics:** Variance, standard deviation, forecast
   accuracy
6. **Satisfaction metrics:** NPS, CSAT, engagement score

Every domain has metrics in at least 4 of these 6 categories.

**processkit implication:** The event-sourced architecture with a
materializer is the correct pattern for metrics. The materializer
computes metrics from raw events. Key insight: processkit should ship
with a small set of universal metrics (lead time, throughput, WIP,
quality gate pass rate) and allow users to define custom metrics via
formulas over event types.

### 2.12 Primitive: Schedule / Cadence

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: PI cadence (8-12 weeks), Iteration cadence (2 weeks), IP
  iteration
- PMBOK: Project schedule, Milestone dates, Sprint duration
- ITIL: Service window, Maintenance window, Review cadence
- Healthcare: Medication schedule, Follow-up interval, Shift schedule
- Legal: Court calendar, Statute of limitations deadline, Filing
  deadline
- Manufacturing: Production schedule, Takt time, Shift pattern,
  Maintenance interval
- Supply Chain: Delivery schedule, Reorder point, Safety stock review
  cycle
- GTD: Weekly review, Daily review
- Shape Up: 6-week cycle + 2-week cooldown
- Kanban: (no fixed cadence -- pull-based -- but often has regular
  replenishment meetings)
- Cron: Cron expression (the ultimate schedule primitive)

**Definition:** A time-based pattern that triggers activities at
regular intervals or specific dates. Cadences create rhythm and
predictability. Deadlines create urgency. Together they structure work
in time.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Schedule name |
| `type` | enum | Recurring cadence, Fixed deadline, Time window |
| `pattern` | string | Recurrence pattern (weekly, biweekly, cron expression) |
| `start_date` | date | When the schedule begins |
| `end_date` | date | When the schedule ends (or null for indefinite) |
| `duration` | duration | How long each occurrence lasts |
| `timezone` | string | Applicable timezone |
| `triggered_process` | reference(Process) | What happens when the schedule fires |

**The Two Fundamental Time Patterns:**

1. **Cadence (recurring):** Regular rhythm that creates
   predictability. Examples: 2-week sprints, quarterly planning,
   annual audits, daily standups, weekly reviews. GTD's weekly review
   is a cadence. SAFe's PI is a cadence.

2. **Deadline (point-in-time):** A specific date/time by which
   something must happen. Examples: filing deadlines, release dates,
   contract expiration, statute of limitations. Deadlines create
   urgency and are often externally imposed.

Every process framework uses one or both. Even "flow-based" approaches
like Kanban, which reject iteration cadences, still use cadences for
retrospectives and replenishment meetings.

**Relationships:**
- **triggers** Processes and Events
- **constrains** Work Items (deadlines)
- **paces** Scopes/Containers (iteration boundaries)
- **measured-by** Metrics (schedule adherence)
- **owned-by** Roles

**processkit implication:** processkit should support: (1) user-defined
cadences (daily, weekly, per-sprint, per-PI), (2) deadline tracking on
work items, (3) cadence-triggered processes (retrospective, planning,
review).

---

### 2.13 Primitive: Scope / Container

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Portfolio, Value Stream, ART, Team, PI (as a time-bounded
  scope)
- PMBOK: Project, Program, Portfolio, Phase, Work Package (as scope
  boundary)
- ITIL: Service, Service Portfolio, IT Service
- Healthcare: Ward, Department, Patient encounter, Care episode
- Legal: Case, Matter, Docket, Practice group
- Manufacturing: Product line, Assembly line, Work cell, Plant
- Supply Chain: Warehouse, Distribution center, Fulfillment zone,
  Channel
- GTD: Project (outcome requiring multiple actions), Area of
  responsibility
- PARA: Project, Area, Resource, Archive
- Shape Up: Bet (a 6-week scope), Scope (within a bet)
- GitHub: Repository, Organization, Project board, Milestone
- Jira: Project, Board, Sprint, Epic (as container)
- Kanban: Board, Swim lane

**Definition:** A boundary that groups related items together and
defines a context for work. Scopes are the organizational hierarchy --
they answer "where does this belong?" Scopes can be nested (portfolio
> project > sprint > task).

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Container name |
| `type` | enum | Portfolio, Project, Iteration, Team, Area, etc. |
| `description` | text | Purpose and boundaries |
| `parent` | reference(Scope) | Enclosing scope (for nesting) |
| `owner` | reference(Role) | Who is responsible for this scope |
| `state` | enum | Active, Planned, Completed, Archived |
| `start_date` | date | When this scope is active from |
| `end_date` | date | When this scope ends (or null for ongoing) |
| `constraints` | reference(Constraint)[] | Rules that apply within this scope |

**State machine:**
```
Planned --> Active --> Completed --> Archived
               |
               +--> Suspended
               +--> Cancelled
```

**The Universal Nesting Pattern:**

Every domain exhibits hierarchical scoping, typically 3-5 levels deep:

| Domain | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SAFe | Portfolio | Value Stream/ART | Team | Iteration |
| PMBOK | Portfolio | Program | Project | Phase/WP |
| Healthcare | Hospital | Department | Ward | Patient Encounter |
| Legal | Firm | Practice Group | Matter | Task |
| Manufacturing | Company | Plant | Line | Station |
| Supply Chain | Network | Region | Warehouse | Zone |
| PARA | (all) | Project/Area | | |
| GTD | (all) | Area of Focus | Project | Next Action |

**Relationships:**
- **contains** Work Items, Artifacts, Events, Roles, sub-Scopes
- **governed-by** Processes and Constraints
- **measured-by** Metrics (aggregated from contents)
- **owned-by** Roles
- **bounded-by** Schedules (time-boxed scopes like sprints)

**processkit implication:** processkit should: (1) support project-level
and sub-project scoping, (2) allow work items to belong to a scope,
(3) aggregate metrics per scope. The PARA model's
Project/Area/Resource/Archive maps well to the context directory
structure (active projects, ongoing areas, reference material,
archive/).

### 2.14 Primitive: Constraint

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Guardrails (budget, scope, quality), PI objectives bounds
- PMBOK: Constraint (scope, time, cost -- the "triple constraint"),
  Assumption
- CMMI: Policy, Standard, Regulation
- ITIL: SLA, OLA (Operational Level Agreement), Underpinning Contract
- Healthcare: Regulation (HIPAA, FDA), Clinical guideline, Formulary
  restriction
- Legal: Statute, Regulation, Precedent, Jurisdiction, Ethical rule
- Manufacturing: Specification limit (USL/LSL), Safety regulation,
  Environmental regulation
- Supply Chain: Customs regulation, Trade agreement, Capacity limit,
  Lead time constraint
- BPMN: Rule (Business Rule Task)
- Six Sigma: Specification limits (USL, LSL), Process capability
  requirement
- ISO 9001: Requirement, Statutory/regulatory requirement
- Kanban: WIP limit

**Definition:** A rule, limit, regulation, or condition that restricts
the degrees of freedom in how work is performed. Constraints are the
boundaries within which all other primitives operate. They are not
optional -- violation of a constraint is a nonconformity or compliance
failure.

This primitive was **not in the original hypothesis** but emerged
strongly from cross-domain analysis. Every domain has hard constraints
that shape all processes. WIP limits in Kanban, specification limits in
manufacturing, SLAs in IT service management, statutes in law,
regulations in healthcare -- these are all the same underlying
primitive.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Constraint name |
| `type` | enum | Regulatory, Policy, Resource, Time, Quality, Budget |
| `description` | text | What the constraint requires or prohibits |
| `scope` | reference(Scope) | Where this constraint applies |
| `severity` | enum | Mandatory (violation = noncompliance) or Advisory (best practice) |
| `source` | string | Where the constraint comes from (regulation, policy, contract, physics) |
| `enforcement` | enum | Automated, Manual, Audit-based |
| `violation_action` | reference(Process) | What happens when violated |

**State machine:** Constraints are definitions, not instances. They are
either Active or Inactive.
```
Draft --> Active --> Superseded
            |
            +--> Suspended (temporary waiver)
```

**Relationships:**
- **restricts** Work Items, Processes, Scopes, Roles
- **enforced-at** Checkpoints/Gates
- **violated-by** Events (triggering corrective action)
- **derived-from** external sources (laws, contracts, policies)
- **measured-by** Metrics (compliance rate, violation count)
- **documented-as** Artifacts (policy documents, SLAs)

**processkit implication:** processkit should support constraint
definitions that are enforced by quality gates and process steps.
Examples: "WIP limit of 5 items in progress," "all code changes require
review," "maximum response time of 2 hours for critical incidents."
Constraints bridge the gap between process definitions and automated
enforcement.

---

### 2.15 Primitive: Context / Environment

**Also known as:**
- SAFe: Solution Context, Portfolio Context
- PMBOK: Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs), Organizational
  Process Assets (OPAs)
- CMMI: Organizational environment, Standard environment
- ITIL: Service environment, Configuration baseline
- Healthcare: Patient context (allergies, medications, history),
  Clinical setting
- Legal: Jurisdiction, Applicable law, Case background
- Manufacturing: Production environment, Tooling setup, Environmental
  conditions
- Supply Chain: Market conditions, Supplier landscape, Demand forecast
- GTD: Context (@phone, @computer, @errands, @office)
- Systems Thinking: System boundary, Environment

**Definition:** The ambient information, conditions, and configuration
that surrounds and influences work but is not itself a work item.
Context is "everything you need to know to do the work effectively."
It includes the environment in which work happens, the background
knowledge required, and the situational factors that affect decisions.

This primitive was **not in the original hypothesis** but is
fundamental -- especially for AI agents that need explicit context to
function. Every framework acknowledges that work does not happen in a
vacuum; the environment shapes everything.

**Universal attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | Context name |
| `type` | enum | Environmental, Organizational, Technical, Regulatory, Situational |
| `description` | text | What conditions or knowledge this represents |
| `scope` | reference(Scope) | Where this context applies |
| `artifacts` | reference(Artifact)[] | Documents, configs, knowledge bases |
| `constraints` | reference(Constraint)[] | Active constraints in this context |
| `valid_from` | date | When this context became effective |
| `valid_until` | date | When this context expires (or null) |

**Relationships:**
- **surrounds** all other primitives within its Scope
- **contains** Artifacts (reference material, configuration)
- **imposes** Constraints
- **informs** Decisions
- **consumed-by** Roles (especially AI agents that need explicit
  context loading)

**processkit implication:** This is perhaps the most important
primitive for processkit. The entire `context/` directory IS this
primitive. processkit's core value proposition is structuring context
so that AI agents and humans can work effectively. AGENTS.md, work
instructions, research -- these are all context artifacts. processkit
should treat the context directory as a first-class, typed, versioned
environment that is loaded into agents at the start of every work
session. The GTD "@context" concept maps to processkit's process
flavors -- different contexts for different work types.

## 4. The Primitive Composition Model

These 15 primitives compose to express any process framework. Here are
examples showing how different frameworks are built from the same
atoms:

### 4.1 SAFe 6.0 Expressed in Primitives

| SAFe Concept | Primitive Composition |
|---|---|
| Portfolio | Scope(type=portfolio) |
| Epic | Work Item(type=epic, parent=portfolio) + State Machine(portfolio-kanban) |
| Lean Business Case | Artifact(type=business-case) + Checkpoint(gate=epic-approval) |
| ART | Scope(type=art) with Role(type=RTE) |
| Feature | Work Item(type=feature, parent=art-backlog) |
| PI | Scope(type=pi) + Schedule(cadence=8-12-weeks) |
| PI Planning | Process(trigger=pi-start) with Checkpoint(gate=commitment) |
| Story | Work Item(type=story, parent=feature) |

**Universality score:** All 15 primitives appear in at least 5 of 7
domains surveyed. Work Item, Log Entry, Role, Process, Category, and
Scope appear in all 7. This confirms the ontology is genuinely
universal.

---

## 6. Minimal Viable Primitive Set

Not all 15 primitives are equally fundamental. They can be layered:

**Layer 0 -- Irreducible Core (cannot build any process without
these):**
1. **Work Item** -- something to do
2. **Log Entry / Event** -- record of what happened
3. **State Machine** -- lifecycle governance
4. **Role** -- who does it

**Layer 1 -- Structural (needed to organize work at scale):**
5. **Scope / Container** -- grouping boundary
6. **Cross-Reference / Relation** -- connections between items
7. **Category / Taxonomy** -- classification

**Layer 2 -- Process (needed to define how work flows):**
8. **Process / Workflow** -- sequence of steps
9. **Checkpoint / Gate** -- quality enforcement
10. **Artifact** -- produced outputs
11. **Schedule / Cadence** -- time structure

**Layer 3 -- Governance (needed for continuous improvement and
compliance):**
12. **Decision Record** -- rationale preservation
13. **Metric / Measure** -- quantified feedback
14. **Constraint** -- rules and limits
15. **Context / Environment** -- ambient knowledge

This layering matters for processkit because it defines the
implementation order: Layer 0 must exist before anything else works.
Each subsequent layer adds capability but requires the previous layers.

---

## 7. Recommendations for processkit

### 7.1 Architecture Recommendations

1. **Implement all 15 primitives as first-class concepts in the
   context system.** Each primitive should have a recognizable
   representation in the context directory structure.

2. **Missing or underspecified primitives to add:**
   - **State Machine** -- currently implicit; should be explicit and
     configurable per work item type
   - **Checkpoint / Gate** -- exists as trigger but should be a
     standalone concept with criteria lists
   - **Metric** -- needs a metric definition format
   - **Schedule / Cadence** -- user-facing cadence definitions are
     needed
   - **Constraint** -- not currently represented; add as a section in
     project config or a dedicated file
   - **Cross-Reference** -- should support structured references
   - **Category / Taxonomy** -- should support user-defined dimensions

3. **Primitive schema definitions.** Create a `schemas/primitives/`
   directory with versioned schema definitions for each primitive.
   These schemas define the universal attributes, allowed states, and
   relationships. Process packages then reference these schemas.

### 7.2 Context Directory Mapping

Recommended mapping of primitives to context directory structure:

```
context/
  items/
    work/              -- Work Items
    decision/          -- Decision Records
    scope/             -- Scopes
    role/              -- Role definitions
    process/           -- Process instances
    gate/              -- Checkpoint/Gate definitions
    metric/            -- Metric definitions
    schedule/          -- Schedules
    constraint/        -- Constraints
    discussion/        -- Discussions
    artifact/          -- Artifact metadata
  events/              -- Event log (JSONL)
  schemas/
    state-machines/    -- State machine definitions
    categories/        -- Category/taxonomy definitions
  work-instructions/   -- Context (reference material)
  research/            -- Artifact (research outputs)
  archive/             -- Scope (archived items)
```

### 7.3 Process Package Mapping

The composable process packages should map to primitive combinations:

| Process Package | Primary Primitives Used |
|---|---|
| core (always present) | Context, Role |
| backlog | Work Item, State Machine, Category |
| decisions | Decision Record |
| standups | Log Entry, Schedule |
| retrospectives | Log Entry, Metric, Schedule, Process |
| projects | Scope, Cross-Reference |
| research | Artifact, Log Entry |
| releases | Process, Checkpoint, Artifact |
| code-review | Process, Checkpoint, Role |
| estimation | Metric, Category (size), Work Item |
| quality-gates | Checkpoint, Constraint, Metric |
| documentation | Artifact, Process |
| incident-response | Work Item (incident type), Process, Constraint (SLA) |

### 7.4 Implementation Priority

Based on the layered model (Section 6), the implementation order
should be:

**Phase 1 -- Already done (Layer 0-1):**
- Work Item
- Role
- Scope (context/ structure)
- Category (informal tags/labels)
- Cross-Reference (informal text mentions)

**Phase 2 -- In progress (Layer 1-2):**
- Log Entry / Event (event log)
- Process (templates/processes/*.md)
- Checkpoint (quality gate triggers)
- Artifact (implicit via files)

**Phase 3 -- Next (Layer 2-3):**
- State Machine -- explicit, configurable state definitions per work
  item type
- Metric -- metric definition format + materializer computation
- Schedule -- user-facing cadence definitions
- Decision Record enhancements -- add structured
  alternatives/consequences

**Phase 4 -- Future (Layer 3):**
- Constraint -- formal constraint definitions with automated
  enforcement
- Context -- typed context loading for agents (which context files to
  load when)
- Cross-Reference -- structured reference index with broken-link
  detection
- Category -- user-defined taxonomy dimensions

### 7.5 Key Design Principles

1. **Primitives are domain-agnostic.** The primitive definitions never
   mention "software" or "code." A Work Item is equally valid for a
   legal case, a manufacturing order, or a research task. Domain
   specificity comes from the *configuration* (state machine
   definitions, category values, process templates), not the
   primitives themselves.

2. **Composition over prescription.** processkit should not prescribe
   "use SAFe" or "use Kanban." It should provide the 15 primitives
   and let users (or process packages) compose them into whatever
   framework fits their domain.

3. **Events are the source of truth.** Every state change, decision,
   checkpoint evaluation, and metric computation should be traceable
   to events. This is the event-sourcing principle: the event log is
   the primary data store; everything else is a materialized view.

4. **Progressive elaboration.** Users start with Layer 0 primitives
   (work items with states and owners) and add layers as needed. A
   solo developer needs Layer 0-1. A team needs Layer 2. An
   organization needs Layer 3. processkit's composable process
   packages already align with this model.

5. **Text-first, schema-validated.** Primitives are represented as
   Markdown with structured metadata (frontmatter, tables, or inline
   YAML). This keeps the human-readable quality that makes processkit
   context useful for AI agents while allowing programmatic validation
   against schemas.
