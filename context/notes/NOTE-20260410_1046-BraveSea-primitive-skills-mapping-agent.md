# Primitive-to-Skills Mapping: Agent API for the Context System

**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Purpose:** Map each of the 17 primitives to the skills agents need
to work with them. Skills are the agent's API to the context system.

---

## Why Skills per Primitive?

In the probabilistic agent model, agents interact with primitives by
reading and editing markdown files. Without skills, every agent must
independently figure out: JSONL event format, frontmatter schema, file
naming conventions, sharding paths, three-level rule structure, ID
generation, RBAC interpretation, and more.

Skills encode "how to interact with this primitive correctly." They are
the agent's API -- not enforced deterministically, but followed
probabilistically because the instructions are loaded into the agent's
context.

**Principle:** Every primitive that an agent creates, reads, updates,
or deletes should have a corresponding skill. The skill handles the
mechanical correctness so the agent can focus on judgment and
decisions.

## Inventory: Existing Skills vs Needed Skills

### Already Exists (needs updating for new system)

| Primitive | Existing Skill | Status | Migration Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Work Item | `backlog-context` | Implemented | Heavy -- currently manages BACKLOG.md table, needs rewrite for file-per-entity |
| Decision Record | `decisions-adr` | Implemented | Heavy -- currently manages DECISIONS.md table, needs rewrite for file-per-entity |
| Context / Environment | `context-archiving` | Implemented | Medium -- archiving logic stays, file paths change |
| Role (partial) | `agent-management` | Implemented | Medium -- already handles agent roles, needs Actor primitive support |
| Checkpoint / Gate (partial) | `code-review` | Implemented | Light -- already a quality gate process, add gate entity awareness |
| Schedule / Cadence (partial) | `standup-context` | Implemented | Medium -- standups are a cadence-triggered process |
| Log Entry / Event | `event-log` | Registered but NOT implemented | New -- this is the critical missing skill |
| Actor (partial) | `owner-profile` | Registered but NOT implemented | New -- needs to create/update Actor entities |

### Does Not Exist Yet (needs creation)

| Primitive | Needed Skill | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Process / Workflow | `process-management` | High |
| Scope / Container | `scope-management` | High |
| Metric / Measure | `metrics` | Medium |
| Constraint | `constraint-management` | Medium |
| Category / Taxonomy | `taxonomy-management` | Low |
| State Machine | `state-machine-management` | Low |
| Cross-Reference / Relation | (embedded in other skills) | N/A |
| Discussion | `discussion-management` | Medium |
| Artifact | `artifact-tracking` | Low |

## Skill Definitions per Primitive

### 1. Work Item Skill -- `workitem` (rewrite of `backlog-context`)

**What the agent does with work items:** Create, update state, update
fields, assign, prioritize, link to other items, query status, close,
archive.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** Generate word-ID via `processkit id generate --kind
  WorkItem`. Create file at correct sharding path. Use
  apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec frontmatter. Write Level 1 intro. Log
  creation event via `event-log` skill.
- **Update state:** Read current state. Check state machine definition
  (plain English guards). Edit `spec.state` field. Log state-change
  event.
- **Update fields:** Edit frontmatter fields. Log field-change event.
- **Assign:** Set `spec.owner` to actor reference. Check RBAC (can
  this actor take this role on this item?). Log assignment event.
- **Link:** Add entry to `spec.refs` array with typed relationship.
  Log reference event.
- **Query:** Read files directly, or suggest user run `processkit
  sync` then query index.
- **Close:** Transition to terminal state. Log completion event.
  (Archiving is separate, handled by `context-archiving`.)
- **RBAC awareness:** Check requesting user's Role permissions before
  modifying. If unauthorized, explain and suggest escalation per
  Role's `escalation` field.

**File naming:** `BACK-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/work/` (with sharding per config)

**Dependencies:** `event-log` (for logging), `taxonomy-management`
(for valid categories)

---

### 2. Event Log Skill -- `event-log` (new, critical)

**What the agent does with events:** Append process events -- state
changes, decisions, comments, gate evaluations, metric observations,
assignment changes, anything noteworthy that happened.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **When to log:** ALWAYS. Every state change, every decision, every
  gate evaluation, every notable action. This is the single most
  important habit. The event log is the source of truth for history.
- **Format:** Append one JSONL line to
  `context/events/YYYY-MM.jsonl`:
  ```jsonl
  {"id":"EVT-<word-id>","ts":"<ISO8601>","type":"<event-type>","actor":"<who>","subject":"<entity-id>","description":"<what happened>","data":{<structured payload>}}
  ```
- **Event types:** `state-change`, `creation`, `comment`,
  `assignment`, `gate-result`, `metric-sample`, `decision-made`,
  `reference-added`, `field-change`, `escalation`, `process-started`,
  `process-completed`
- **Generate event ID:** Use `processkit id generate --kind Event`
- **Actor field:** Always record who initiated the action (human user
  or agent identity)
- **Subject field:** Always reference the entity ID the event is about
- **Data field:** Structured payload -- for state changes:
  `{"from":"ready","to":"in-progress"}`, for comments:
  `{"body":"..."}`, for gate results:
  `{"gate":"GATE-xxx","result":"passed"}`
- **Never edit past events.** Corrections are new events that
  reference the original.

**This skill's instructions must be prominent in all scaffolded process
documentation.** The agent should internalize: "if I did something, I
log it."

**File naming:** Events don't get their own files -- they're lines in
monthly JSONL.
**Location:** `context/events/YYYY-MM.jsonl` (sharding per config)

**Dependencies:** None (this is the foundational skill other skills
depend on)

---

### 3. Decision Record Skill -- `decision` (rewrite of
`decisions-adr`)

**What the agent does with decisions:** Record choices with context,
alternatives, rationale, and consequences. Track decision lifecycle
(proposed -> accepted -> deprecated / superseded).

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** Generate word-ID. Create file with
  apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec frontmatter. Body follows three-level
  rule: Level 1 = one-line "what was decided", Level 2 = context and
  decision summary, Level 3 = alternatives, consequences, discussion.
  Log creation event.
- **Accept:** Transition state proposed -> accepted. Log event.
- **Supersede:** Create new decision referencing the old. Set old
  decision's `spec.superseded_by`. Log event on both entities.
- **Link:** Decisions typically reference work items they affect
  (`spec.refs`).

**File naming:** `DEC-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/decision/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`

---

### 4. Actor Profile Skill -- `actor-profile` (rewrite of
`owner-profile`)

**What the agent does with actors:** Create and maintain profiles for
humans and AI agents that the project's agents work with.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** When a new human or agent joins the project. Generate
  word-ID. Include: name, type (human/ai-agent), expertise,
  communication preferences, working hours, roles filled. For AI
  agents: model, context window size, tool access.
- **Update:** When the agent learns new information about an actor
  (new expertise, changed preferences, new role assignment).
- **Read:** Before interacting with a human, check their actor profile
  for communication preferences. Before assigning work, check
  expertise.
- **RBAC context:** The actor profile links to roles. When checking
  permissions, the agent reads actor -> roles ->
  permissions/restrictions.

**File naming:** `ACTOR-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/actor/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `role-management`

---

### 5. Role Management Skill -- `role-management` (new)

**What the agent does with roles:** Define roles with permissions and
restrictions. Assign actors to roles. Check permissions before actions.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** Define a new role with name, permissions (plain
  English), restrictions (plain English), escalation path. Log event.
- **Assign:** Link an actor to a role by adding to `spec.filled_by`
  on the Role and updating the Actor's profile. Log assignment event.
- **Check permissions:** Before modifying any entity, read the
  requesting user's roles and check permissions/restrictions. If
  restricted, explain and suggest escalation. This check should be
  habitual -- part of every modification action.
- **Escalation:** When a request exceeds permissions, follow the
  role's `spec.escalation` field (typically: suggest asking an admin
  role holder).

**File naming:** `ROLE-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/role/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `actor-profile`

---

### 6. Process Management Skill -- `process-management` (new)

**What the agent does with processes:** Read process definitions,
follow process steps, start and complete process instances, track
which step is current.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Follow:** When a process is triggered (e.g., PR created -> code
  review process), read the process definition. Create a work item
  with `subtype: process-instance` and `process_def: PROC-xxx`.
  Follow steps in order, logging events at each step.
- **Create/Edit definition:** When the project owner asks to change a
  process (check RBAC first -- typically requires admin role). Edit
  the process definition file directly.
- **Suggest:** When the agent recognizes a situation that matches a
  process trigger, suggest starting the process. ("This looks like a
  bug report -- shall I follow the bug-fix process?")

**File naming:** `PROC-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/process/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `workitem` (for process instances),
`role-management` (RBAC)

---

### 7. Scope Management Skill -- `scope-management` (new)

**What the agent does with scopes:** Create and manage project scopes,
iterations, team boundaries. Group entities within scopes. Track scope
lifecycle.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** New project, iteration, or team scope. Generate word-ID.
  Set parent scope for nesting. Log event.
- **Assign entities:** Set `spec.scope` on work items, artifacts, etc.
  to group them.
- **Status tracking:** Monitor scope state (planned -> active ->
  completed -> archived).
- **Aggregate:** When asked about scope status, read all entities
  within the scope and summarize (how many items
  open/in-progress/done, any blockers, etc.).

**File naming:** `PROJ-<word-id>.md` (for project scopes),
`SCOPE-<word-id>.md` (for iterations, teams, areas)
**Location:** `context/items/scope/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `workitem`

---

### 8. Gate / Checkpoint Skill -- `gate-management` (new, extends
`code-review`)

**What the agent does with gates:** Define quality checkpoints,
evaluate gate criteria, record pass/fail/waive results.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create gate with criteria list (plain English), severity
  (blocking/advisory), authority (which role can waive). Log event.
- **Evaluate:** When a work item or artifact reaches a gate, check
  each criterion. Record the result as an event via `event-log` (type:
  `gate-result`). If failed: explain which criteria failed and what
  needs fixing.
- **Waive:** If authority role requests a waiver, record waiver event
  with justification.
- **Code review as gate:** The existing `code-review` skill IS a gate
  evaluation. It should log its results as gate events.

**File naming:** `GATE-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/gate/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `role-management` (for authority checks)

---

### 9. Metric Skill -- `metrics` (new)

**What the agent does with metrics:** Define metrics, compute values
from events, report on metric health, detect threshold breaches.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create metric with name, description, unit, formula
  (plain English), target value, thresholds. Log event.
- **Compute:** When asked about a metric, read relevant events from
  the event log and compute the value. For example: lead time =
  average time from state `ready` to state `done` across recent work
  items. Report as green/yellow/red against thresholds.
- **Sample:** Record a metric observation as an event (type:
  `metric-sample`).
- **Report:** When asked for a project health summary, compute all
  defined metrics and present a dashboard-style report.

**Note:** Computation is probabilistic -- the agent reads events and
calculates. For large event volumes, suggest the user run `processkit
sync` to populate the SQLite index and query from there. The metric
definition's formula is plain English guidance for the agent, not
executable code.

**File naming:** `MET-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/metric/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`

---

### 10. Constraint Skill -- `constraint-management` (new)

**What the agent does with constraints:** Define rules and limits,
check compliance, flag violations.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create constraint with description, severity
  (mandatory/advisory), scope, enforcement guidance. Log event.
- **Check compliance:** Before or after actions, review applicable
  constraints. For example: WIP limit constraint -> count in-progress
  items before starting new work. If violated, warn and suggest
  corrective action.
- **Flag violations:** When `processkit lint` or the agent detects a
  constraint violation, log an event and notify the relevant role.

**File naming:** `CON-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/constraint/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `role-management`

---

### 11. Schedule / Cadence Skill -- `schedule-management` (new,
extends `standup-context`)

**What the agent does with schedules:** Define cadences and deadlines,
remind about upcoming events, trigger scheduled processes.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create schedule with pattern (weekly, biweekly, etc.),
  trigger description, associated process. Log event.
- **Remind:** When a session starts, check active schedules. If a
  cadence is due or overdue, remind the user. ("Weekly review is due
  -- last one was 8 days ago.")
- **Trigger:** When a scheduled event fires, suggest starting the
  associated process. ("Retrospective cadence reached -- shall I
  facilitate a retro?")
- **Deadline tracking:** Monitor work items with `spec.due_date`. Warn
  when deadlines approach. Flag overdue items.

**Note:** There is no cron daemon. The agent checks schedules at the
start of each session. Cadences are advisory -- the agent suggests,
the human decides.

**File naming:** `SCHED-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/schedule/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `process-management`

---

### 12. Discussion Skill -- `discussion-management` (new)

**What the agent does with discussions:** Facilitate structured
discussions, record arguments, track open questions, produce decisions.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Create:** When a topic requires exploration with multiple
  perspectives, create a discussion entity. Link related work items
  and research. Log event.
- **Continue:** Append new sections to the discussion body as the
  conversation progresses. Number sections sequentially. Record
  arguments, counterarguments, and resolutions.
- **Produce decisions:** When a discussion point is resolved, create a
  Decision Record via the `decision` skill and link it. Update the
  discussion's decisions section.
- **Conclude:** When all open questions are resolved (or explicitly
  deferred), transition state to concluded. Log event.

**File naming:** `DISC-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/discussion/`

**Dependencies:** `event-log`, `decision`

---

### 13. Taxonomy Skill -- `taxonomy-management` (new)

**What the agent does with categories:** Define classification
dimensions, assign categories to entities, ensure consistency.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create category dimension (priority, type, area, size,
  etc.) as a YAML schema file. Include allowed values, whether
  exclusive, whether hierarchical.
- **Assign:** When creating or updating entities, use values from
  defined taxonomies. Validate against allowed values.
- **Suggest:** When the agent sees an entity without categories,
  suggest appropriate classifications based on content.
- **Evolve:** When new category values are needed, add them to the
  taxonomy definition (check RBAC -- typically requires admin role).

**File naming:** `context/schemas/categories/<name>.yaml`
**Location:** Schema files, not entity files

**Dependencies:** None (foundational configuration)

---

### 14. State Machine Skill -- `state-machine-management` (new)

**What the agent does with state machines:** Define allowed states and
transitions, check validity of transitions, suggest next valid states.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Define:** Create state machine YAML with states, transitions,
  plain English guards, and suggestions. Check RBAC.
- **Consult:** Before transitioning an entity, read the applicable
  state machine. Check the guard (in English). If the guard suggests
  conditions aren't met, warn and suggest what to do first.
- **Suggest:** When an entity is in a given state, suggest valid next
  transitions. ("This item is in-review -- valid transitions: done
  (approve), in-progress (reject), cancelled.")

**File naming:** `context/schemas/state-machines/<name>.yaml`
**Location:** Schema files, not entity files

**Dependencies:** None (foundational configuration)

---

### 15. Artifact Tracking Skill -- `artifact-tracking` (new)

**What the agent does with artifacts:** Track external artifacts
(builds, releases, deployments) that don't live in the context
directory. For content-primary artifacts (research, docs), maintain
frontmatter consistency.

**Skill instructions (summary):**

- **Track:** When the project produces a notable output (release,
  deployment, published doc), create an artifact entity pointing to
  its location. Log event.
- **Frontmatter maintenance:** When creating research reports or work
  instructions, ensure proper apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec
  frontmatter and three-level body structure.
- **Version:** When an artifact is updated, increment version in
  frontmatter. Log event.

**File naming:** `ART-<word-id>.md`
**Location:** `context/items/artifact/` (for metadata-primary), or
in-place (for content-primary with frontmatter)

**Dependencies:** `event-log`

---

### 16. Context Archiving Skill -- `context-archiving` (existing,
needs update)

**What the agent does:** Move completed/old entities to archive.
Maintain archive structure. Update index.

**Skill updates needed:**
- File-per-entity archiving (move individual files, not table rows)
- Archive path mirrors hot path:
  `context/archive/items/work/BACK-swift-oak.md`
- Log archive events via `event-log`
- Compression of old event log files (JSONL -> .jsonl.gz)

**Dependencies:** `event-log`

---

### 17. Session Handover Skill -- `session-handover` (existing, needs
update)

**What the agent does:** At session end, produce a handover document
for the next agent.

**Skill updates needed:**
- Reference entities by word-IDs
- Include summary of events logged this session
- Reference active discussions and their open questions

**Dependencies:** `event-log`

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### RBAC Integration

RBAC is NOT a separate skill -- it's a **cross-cutting instruction
embedded in every entity-modifying skill.** Every skill that creates,
updates, or deletes an entity must include the instruction:

> Before modifying, check the requesting user's Actor profile -> Roles
> -> permissions and restrictions. If the action is restricted for this
> role, explain why and suggest escalation per the Role's escalation
> field.

This is repeated in each skill rather than abstracted into a separate
skill, because the agent needs to encounter it at the point of action,
not as a separate lookup.

### Event Logging Integration

Similarly, event logging is cross-cutting. Every entity-modifying
skill includes:

> After completing this action, log it via the event-log skill. Always.

The `event-log` skill itself defines the format. Other skills
reference it.

### INDEX.md Maintenance

When any skill creates or modifies files in a directory, it should
update the directory's INDEX.md if one exists. This is a cross-cutting
instruction:

> After creating or modifying a file, check if the directory has an
> INDEX.md. If so, update it to reflect the change. If the directory
> has many files and no INDEX.md, suggest creating one.

---

## Design Refinements (resolved in discussion)

### Skill Naming -- Long descriptive names

Use `<noun>-management` for CRUD skills, `<noun>-<verb>` for
action-specific skills. Full revised naming:

| Skill | Primitive |
|---|---|
| `workitem-management` | Work Item |
| `event-log-management` | Log Entry / Event |
| `decision-record-management` | Decision Record |
| `actor-profile-management` | Actor |
| `role-management` | Role |
| `process-management` | Process / Workflow |
| `state-machine-management` | State Machine |
| `taxonomy-management` | Category / Taxonomy |
| `gate-management` | Checkpoint / Gate |
| `metrics-management` | Metric / Measure |
| `schedule-management` | Schedule / Cadence |
| `scope-management` | Scope / Container |
| `constraint-management` | Constraint |
| `discussion-management` | Discussion |
| `artifact-tracking` | Artifact |
| `context-archiving` | Context / Environment (lifecycle) |
| `session-handover` | (cross-cutting) |

### Skill Hierarchy -- Layered instruction references

Skills reference lower-layer skills by name in their instructions. The
`uses:` field in frontmatter documents dependencies. Dependency is
strictly downward.

```
Layer 0: event-log-management (foundation -- everything depends on this)
Layer 1: role-management, actor-profile-management
Layer 2: workitem-management, decision-record-management, scope-management
Layer 3: process-management, gate-management, schedule-management
Layer 4: discussion-management, metrics-management
```

Example in `workitem-management`:
> "After creating or updating a work item, use the
> **event-log-management** skill to record what you did. Always."
> "Before modifying a work item, use the **role-management** skill to
> check whether the requesting user has permission."

Frontmatter documents this:
```yaml
---
name: workitem-management
uses:
  - event-log-management
  - role-management
  - taxonomy-management
---
```

### Skill Size -- One per primitive, ~100-200 lines

Existing skills range 17-244 lines. Target ~140 lines per primitive
skill. The three-level rule means agents read only what they need
(Level 1 = when to use, Level 2 = operation overview, Level 3 =
detailed schema/examples). Split only if a skill exceeds ~250 lines.

### Human Vocabulary Mapping

Each skill's "When to Use" must list all human terms that map to the
primitive:

```markdown
## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Add/create a **backlog item**, **task**, **bug**, **feature**,
  **story**, **ticket**, **issue**
- Update, prioritize, assign, or close any of the above
- "What's on the backlog?" / "What am I working on?" /
  "Add this to the list"
```

This ensures "add a backlog item" triggers `workitem-management`.

### Cross-Cutting -- Reference, don't repeat

RBAC and event-log instructions reference the respective skills by
name rather than repeating full instructions. Each entity-modifying
skill includes a brief instruction like "Before modifying, check
permissions per **role-management** skill" and "After modifying, log
via **event-log-management** skill." The referenced skills contain the
detailed how-to.

### Derived Project Customization

Direct editing after scaffolding. Same principle as process files --
the derived project owns its skill files after scaffolding.

`processkit init` stores original templates in
`context/.processkit/templates/<version>/`. Each `processkit update`
adds new version copies. `processkit migrate` generates diffs +
migration instructions. The derived project's agent can compare
originals vs current customized files when analysis is needed.

## Remaining Open Questions

1. **Cross-reference skill:** Cross-references are embedded in entity
   frontmatter (`refs:` field). Should there be a lightweight skill
   specifically for managing references (adding, validating, detecting
   broken links)? Or is this adequately covered as part of each
   entity-modifying skill?
2. **Skill testing:** How do we validate that a skill's instructions
   actually produce correct output? Manual review? Automated test
   cases that simulate agent interactions?
3. **Skill versioning:** Skills evolve. Should skills carry their own
   version in frontmatter? How does this interact with the template
