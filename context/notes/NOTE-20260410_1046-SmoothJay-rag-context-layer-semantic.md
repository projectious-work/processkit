# RAG Layer for Context Directory — Research Report — March 2026

Research for semantic search over the processkit `./context/` directory.
Evaluates embedding models, vector storage, MCP integration, existing
tools, indexing strategies, and query interfaces. Recommends the
simplest approach that works in a devcontainer without GPU. Conducted
2026-03-26.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Projects using processkit have a `./context/` directory with 25-60+
markdown files: research reports, decisions, backlog items, work
instructions, session notes, and architecture docs. As the corpus
grows, finding relevant information by filename or grep becomes
unreliable. A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) layer would enable
semantic search — finding content by meaning rather than exact
keywords.

**Current corpus stats (example project):** 61 markdown files,
~792 KB total, ~15,000 lines.

---

## 2. Embedding Models for CPU Use

All models below run on CPU without GPU. The key tradeoff is model
size vs. quality.

### Comparison Table

| Model | Size | Dimensions | MTEB Score | Runtime | Language | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** | 23MB | 384 | ~63 | ONNX / PyTorch | EN | Fastest, smallest, good baseline |
| **bge-small-en-v1.5** | 33MB | 384 | ~63 | ONNX | EN | Slightly better than MiniLM |
| **bge-base-en-v1.5** | 130MB | 768 | ~64 | ONNX | EN | Good quality/size balance |
| **nomic-embed-text-v1.5** | 137MB | 768 (truncatable to 256) | ~62 | ONNX / PyTorch | EN+multi | Matryoshka dims, open weights |
| **nomic-embed-text-v2-moe** | ~280MB | 768 | ~65 | PyTorch | Multilingual | MoE architecture, heavier |
| **Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B** | ~1.2GB | 1024 | ~67 | Candle/ONNX | Multilingual | High quality, too large for devcontainer |

### Runtime Libraries

| Library | Language | Backend | Model Download | Key Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fastembed (Rust)** | Rust | ONNX Runtime | Auto from HuggingFace | Native Rust, 3-5x faster than Python, quantized models |
| **fastembed (Python)** | Python | ONNX Runtime | Auto from HuggingFace | Simple API, ONNX-optimized for CPU |
| **sentence-transformers** | Python | PyTorch | Auto from HuggingFace | Largest ecosystem, easy fine-tuning |
| **Transformers.js** | JS/TS | ONNX Runtime (WASM) | Auto from HuggingFace | Node.js native, used by mcp-local-rag |

### Recommendation

**fastembed (Rust crate)** with `bge-small-en-v1.5` (quantized).
Rationale:
- No new runtime dependency if the CLI is already Rust
- 33 MB model, ~384-dim vectors, fast on CPU
- ONNX Runtime handles SIMD acceleration automatically
- Quantized variant (`BGESmallENV15Q`) reduces size and latency
  further

---

## 3. Vector Storage

The corpus is small (~61 files, ~500-1000 chunks). Heavy databases
are overkill.

### Comparison Table

| Database | Language | Architecture | RAM (idle) | RAM (search) | Disk | Server Process | Rust Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **sqlite-vec** | C (SQLite ext) | Embedded, file-based | ~5MB | ~10MB | Single .db file | No | Via rusqlite |
| **LanceDB** | Rust core | Embedded, file-based | ~4MB | ~150MB | Lance format dir | No | Native crate |
| **ChromaDB** | Rust (v2) | Client-server or embedded | ~200MB | ~400MB | Directory | Optional | Python/JS SDK |
| **Qdrant** | Rust | Client-server | ~400MB | ~500MB | Directory | Yes (separate) | Native crate |
| **FAISS** | C++ | Library (in-memory) | Varies | Varies | None (manual) | No | C bindings |

### Analysis

**sqlite-vec** is the clear winner for this use case:
- Zero-dependency C extension, works with any SQLite binding
- Single `.db` file — trivial to backup, sync, gitignore
- Handles tens of thousands of vectors efficiently
- KNN search with multiple distance metrics (cosine, L2, dot)
- Accessible via `rusqlite` in Rust with `bundled` feature
- ~5 MB overhead — invisible in a devcontainer

**LanceDB** is a strong alternative if the corpus grows to thousands
of files or needs multimodal search. Its Rust-native crate is
well-maintained, but the Lance format creates a directory of files
rather than a single file.

### Recommendation

**sqlite-vec** via rusqlite. Single file, minimal deps, fits the
"simple tools" philosophy.

## 4. Existing MCP Tools and Prior Art

### MCP Servers for RAG

| Tool | Embedding | Storage | Local? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[mcp-local-rag](https://github.com/shinpr/mcp-local-rag)** | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Transformers.js) | LanceDB | Yes | Node.js, ~200MB idle, semantic chunking |
| **[MCP-Markdown-RAG](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/MCP-Markdown-RAG)** | ~50MB model (unspecified) | Milvus Lite | Yes | Python/uv, heading-based chunking, incremental indexing |
| **[claude-context](https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context)** | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | Zilliz Cloud (Milvus) | No | Requires API keys, hybrid BM25+vector search |
| **[qdrant-rag-mcp](https://github.com/ancoleman/qdrant-rag-mcp)** | Various | Qdrant | Yes (server) | Requires running Qdrant instance |
| **[rag-code-mcp](https://github.com/doITmagic/rag-code-mcp)** | Ollama local LLMs | Qdrant | Yes (server) | Multi-language code focus, heavy |

### Other Tools

| Tool | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Greptile** | SaaS | Full codebase RAG, dependency graphs, cloud-hosted or air-gapped |
| **Sourcegraph Cody** | SaaS/self-hosted | Code intelligence with embeddings, enterprise-focused |
| **code-graph-rag** | Local | AST + knowledge graph + vector search, multi-language |

### Key Insight

MCP-Markdown-RAG is closest to what we need (markdown-focused,
heading-based chunking, incremental indexing), but it uses Python
and Milvus. mcp-local-rag is more mature but uses Node.js and
LanceDB. Neither fits naturally into a Rust CLI.

**Building a thin Rust-native implementation is preferable** — it
avoids adding a Node.js or Python runtime dependency and keeps the
tool self-contained.

---

## 5. Architecture Design

### Chunking Strategy

Markdown files have natural structure. Chunking by heading sections
preserves semantic coherence better than fixed-size splits.

```
# Document Title           --> chunk 1 (title + intro paragraphs)
## Section A               --> chunk 2 (heading + body)
### Subsection A.1         --> chunk 3 (heading + body)
## Section B               --> chunk 4 (heading + body)
```

Each chunk stores:
- `file_path`: relative path from context root
- `heading_path`: e.g., "Document Title > Section A > Subsection A.1"
- `content`: raw text of the section
- `embedding`: vector from fastembed
- `file_mtime`: for incremental updates
- `chunk_hash`: content hash for change detection

### Database Schema (sqlite-vec)

```sql
CREATE TABLE chunks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    heading_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    chunk_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_mtime INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE chunk_vectors USING vec0(
    chunk_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding FLOAT[384]
);

CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_file ON chunks(file_path);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_hash ON chunks(chunk_hash);
```

### Search Flow

```
Query text
  --> fastembed encode --> query vector (384 dims)
  --> sqlite-vec KNN search (cosine distance, top-k=10)
  --> return ranked chunks with file_path, heading_path,
      content snippet
```

---

## 6. Indexing Strategy

### When to Index

| Trigger | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Explicit reindex command** | On-demand full reindex | Explicit user action, ~2-5 seconds for 61 files |
| **Search command** | Incremental before search | Check file mtimes, re-embed only changed files |
| **Post-sync hook** | Reindex after sync completes | Reindex after container sync |
| **File watcher** | inotify/fswatch | Overkill for this corpus size, skip for v1 |

### Incremental Indexing Algorithm

1. Scan `./context/` for all `.md` files
2. For each file, compare `mtime` against stored `file_mtime`
3. If changed: re-chunk, re-hash, re-embed changed chunks, delete
   removed chunks
4. If unchanged: skip
5. Delete chunks for files that no longer exist

**Expected performance:** ~50 ms per file (chunk + embed on CPU),
full reindex of 61 files takes ~3 seconds. Incremental update of
1-2 changed files takes <200 ms.

### Index Location

Store at `./context/.processkit/search.db` (gitignored). The
`.processkit/` directory can also hold other derived data in the
future.

---

## 7. Query Interface

### Option A: CLI Subcommand (Recommended for v1)

```bash
processkit search "how do we handle addon dependencies"
processkit search "what decisions were made about versioning"
processkit search --reindex    # force full reindex
processkit search --top 5 "brand guidelines"
```

Output format:
```
 1. context/research/addon-dependency-design-2026-03.md
    > Dependency Resolution > Algorithm
    Score: 0.87 | "Dependencies between addons are resolved using..."

 2. context/DECISIONS.md
    > Addon dependency ordering
    Score: 0.82 | "Decided to use topological sort for..."
```

### Option B: MCP Server (Recommended for v2)

Expose semantic search as an MCP tool so agents can query it
automatically.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "processkit-search": {
      "command": "processkit",
      "args": ["mcp-serve", "--tools", "search"]
    }
  }
}
```

MCP tool definition:
```json
{
  "name": "context_search",
  "description": "Semantic search over project context documents",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Natural language search query"
      },
      "top_k": { "type": "integer", "default": 5 }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  }
}
```

This enables agents to automatically search context when working on
tasks, without the user needing to manually find and paste relevant
files.

### Option C: Agent Skill

Teach agents to use search by adding instructions to AGENTS.md:
```
When you need context about this project, run:
processkit search "your query"
```

This is the lowest-effort integration and works with any AI coding
tool.

## 8. Scope

### What to Index

| Scope | Files | Size | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `./context/` (non-archive) | ~30 files | ~400KB | v1 — primary use case |
| `./context/archive/` | ~30 files | ~400KB | v1 — include but lower rank |
| `./skills/` descriptions | ~20 files | ~100KB | v2 — useful for "what skill does X" |
| `./docs-site/docs/` | ~15 files | ~200KB | v2 — user-facing docs |
| Source code (Rust) | ~30 files | ~300KB | v3 — needs code-aware chunking |

### Ranking Boost

Apply a recency/importance boost:
- Active context files get 1.2x boost
- Archive files get 0.8x weight
- Research reports and work instructions get 1.0x (default)

---

## 9. Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CLI Search

**Effort:** ~3-5 days

1. Add `fastembed` and `rusqlite` (with sqlite-vec) to
   `cli/Cargo.toml`
2. Implement markdown heading-based chunker
3. Implement incremental indexing with mtime + hash check
4. Implement `processkit search <query>` subcommand
5. Store index at `./context/.processkit/search.db`
6. Add `.processkit/` to default `.gitignore` template

**Dependencies to add:**
```toml
fastembed = "5"          # ONNX embedding, ~33MB model on first run
rusqlite = { version = "0.32", features = ["bundled"] }
# sqlite-vec loaded as extension at runtime
```

### Phase 2: MCP Integration

**Effort:** ~2-3 days (after Phase 1)

1. Add `processkit mcp-serve` subcommand using MCP protocol over
   stdio
2. Expose `context_search` tool
3. Auto-configure in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
4. Claude Code / Cursor / other MCP clients can query context
   automatically

### Phase 3: Extended Scope

- Index skills metadata and docs
- Hybrid search (BM25 keyword + vector)
- Cross-project search (multiple context directories)
- Web UI for browsing indexed content

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ONNX model download on first run (~33MB) | Low | Cache in `~/.cache/fastembed/`, warn user on first run |
| fastembed Rust crate maturity | Medium | Well-maintained (Qdrant team), active releases, fallback to Python fastembed |
| sqlite-vec availability | Low | Distribute as bundled extension or use LanceDB as fallback |
| Embedding quality for technical markdown | Low | bge-small-en works well on technical English; upgrade model later if needed |
| Build time increase from ONNX | Medium | Feature-gate behind `search` cargo feature flag |
| Devcontainer image size increase | Low | ~40MB for model + ONNX runtime, negligible vs base image |

---

## 11. Decision

**Recommended approach:** Rust-native implementation using
`fastembed` (bge-small-en-v1.5) + `sqlite-vec` via rusqlite.
Markdown heading-based chunking with incremental indexing. CLI
subcommand for v1, MCP server for v2.

This is the simplest approach that:
- Requires no additional runtime (no Python, no Node.js, no Docker
  services)
- Works offline after first model download
- Runs on CPU in any devcontainer
- Fits naturally into an existing Rust CLI
- Produces a single index file that is easy to manage
- Can be extended to MCP for automatic agent integration
