# Standup Context

## Intro

A standup update is a brief, structured record of session progress — written
for the team record and for any downstream skill (like `morning-briefing`)
that reconstructs what happened. It lives in `context/logs/` as a
`session.standup` LogEntry. It is NOT a flat `context/STANDUPS.md` file.

## Overview

### The four fields

Every standup has exactly four fields:

- **done** — what was completed since the last standup. Past tense, specific.
  "Merged BACK-042 auth refactor" not "worked on auth."
- **doing** — what is currently in progress. These are the items that
  will appear in the next standup's "done" if work continues.
- **next** — what comes immediately after the current work. One or two items.
  Gives the team visibility on direction.
- **blockers** — anything preventing progress. Empty list if none.
  Be specific: "waiting for Alice to review PR #88" not "blocked on review."

### Writing the LogEntry

```yaml
---
apiVersion: processkit.projectious.work/v1
kind: LogEntry
metadata:
  id: LOG-<next-id>
  created: <ISO 8601 UTC>
spec:
  event_type: session.standup
  timestamp: <ISO 8601 UTC>
  actor: <ACTOR-id or agent name>
  summary: "Standup — <YYYY-MM-DD>"
  details:
    session_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
    done:
      - "<completed item 1>"
      - "<completed item 2>"
    doing:
      - "<in-progress item>"
    next:
      - "<next item>"
    blockers: []
---
```

Save to `context/logs/LOG-<id>-standup-<date>.md`.

### Sourcing the content

Before writing, query:
1. `workitem-management` — filter for `state: done` (completed today) and
   `state: in_progress` (currently doing)
2. Recent `session.handover` or `session.standup` entries — for what the
   previous session left as "next"
3. Git log — `git log --oneline --since="24 hours ago"` for a mechanical
   account of commits since the last standup

Cross-check: if a WorkItem is marked `done` but no commit references it,
note it — might be a missing commit or a premature state transition.

### Trigger phrases

The agent should write a standup when it hears:
- "write a standup" / "standup update"
- "what did I do today" / "summarize today's work"
- "write a status update for the team"
- "daily update"
- "end of day summary"

This skill also provides the `/standup-context-write` slash command for direct invocation — see `commands/standup-context-write.md`.

## Gotchas

- **Writing done in present tense.** "Working on BACK-042" belongs in
  doing, not done. Done means the work is finished. "Completed BACK-042
  auth refactor and merged to main" is done.
- **One-liner entries with no specifics.** "Worked on auth" is not a
  standup item — it gives the team nothing. Reference the WorkItem ID,
  the PR number, or the specific outcome: "Merged auth refactor (BACK-042,
  PR #88); all tests green."
- **Leaving blockers vague.** "Blocked on review" tells the team nothing
  actionable. Name the reviewer, the PR, and how long it has been waiting:
  "PR #88 waiting on Alice — submitted 2026-04-07, no response yet."
- **Conflating doing and next.** Doing is what is actively in progress
  right now. Next is what comes after. The distinction matters: doing items
  might finish today; next items haven't started.
- **Writing a standup without querying WorkItem state.** Memory-based
  standups miss items and include outdated ones. Always check the actual
  WorkItem state before writing.
- **Writing a standup for a period longer than one session without flagging
  it.** If the last standup was three days ago, the "done" list is actually
  three days of work. Flag this in the summary line so the team knows the
  cadence was missed.
- **Including personal context in the team standup.** Blockers like
  "dentist appointment" or "waiting to hear back about contract" belong in
  a `session.handover`, not a standup. Standups are project-facing records.

## Full reference

### Standup vs. session handover

| | standup-context | session-handover |
|---|---|---|
| **When** | Regular cadence (daily or per session) | Before shutdown / container restart |
| **Audience** | The team / project record | The next session (same person or agent) |
| **Focus** | Accountability — what was done | Continuity — what to pick up next |
| **LogEntry type** | `session.standup` | `session.handover` |

### Reading recent standups

To reconstruct what has happened since the last session:

```
query_events(event_type="session.standup", since="<date>", order="asc")
```

`morning-briefing` uses this query to populate its "what happened" section
when no recent `session.handover` exists.

### Output format for sharing

When the user wants to copy a standup to Slack or email, format it as:

```
**Yesterday / last session:**
- <done item 1>
- <done item 2>

**Today:**
- <doing item>
- <next item>

**Blockers:**
- <blocker> (or: none)
```
