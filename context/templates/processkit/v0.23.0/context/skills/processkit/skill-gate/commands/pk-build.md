Read the `<!-- pk-commands BEGIN -->` ... `<!-- pk-commands END -->` block
from the project's AGENTS.md. Extract the value for the `build` key.

If the value is a non-empty string, run it via Bash. Report the result:
pass/fail status and a brief summary of the output (last 20 lines on
failure, one-line confirmation on success).

If the value is an empty string `""`, tell the user: "No build command
configured for this project. Add it to the pk-commands block in
AGENTS.md."
