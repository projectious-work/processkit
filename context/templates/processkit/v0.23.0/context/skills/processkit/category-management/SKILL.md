# Category Management

## Intro

A Category is a named classification — a list of possible values for a
labeling axis. Examples: priority (critical/high/medium/low), bug severity
(sev1/sev2/sev3), feature tier (core/enhancement/experiment), product area
(frontend/backend/infra).

## Overview

### When to create a Category

Create a Category when:
- A labeling axis is used across many entities
- The values are constrained to a specific set
- The set is worth documenting (meanings, SLAs per value)

Don't create a Category for one-off tags or freeform labels.

### Shape

```yaml
---
apiVersion: processkit.projectious.work/v1
kind: Category
metadata:
  id: CAT-priority
  created: 2026-04-06T00:00:00Z
spec:
  name: priority
  description: "Business priority for work items."
  axis: priority
  values:
    - name: critical
      description: "Drop everything. Affects production or blocks a release."
    - name: high
      description: "Top of the queue. Assigned this sprint."
    - name: medium
      description: "Important but schedulable."
    - name: low
      description: "Nice to have. Pick up when capacity allows."

```

### Using a category

Entities tag themselves via `metadata.labels.<axis>: <value>` or
`spec.<axis>: <value>`. The index MCP server validates that the value is
one of the category's defined values.

### Workflow

1. Pick `CAT-<axis>` where axis is the labeling dimension.
2. List `values` with clear, non-overlapping definitions.
3. Declare which primitive `kinds` this category `applies_to`.
4. Save to `context/categories/`.
5. When you add a new value, write a `category.value_added` LogEntry so
   the change is traceable.

## Gotchas

Agent-specific failure modes — provider-neutral pause-and-self-check items:

- **Creating a Category when an enum field would suffice.** If the
  values are fixed and known at design time (e.g., `priority:
  low|medium|high|critical`), put them in the entity's schema
  enum, not in a Category entity. Categories are for taxonomies
  the project actively curates.
- **Inventing a new Category when an existing one fits.** Always
  list existing categories first via `list_categories`. Two
  Categories with overlapping meaning ("severity" and "priority"
  both used for bugs) is a maintenance trap.
- **Categories with overlapping meaning.** If two Categories cover
  the same axis from different angles, merge them or pick one as
  canonical. Overlap silently splits the same data into different
  buckets and breaks reports.
- **Forgetting to mark a Category as deprecated when superseded.**
  Don't just stop using a Category and leave it in the catalog —
  set its state to deprecated so future queries don't surface it
  as a current option.
- **Adding categories without examples.** A Category like "Tier 1"
  with no description of what qualifies is an empty bucket. Each
  Category value should ship with at least one example so future
  agents apply it consistently.
- **Treating Category as a tag.** Categories are structured
  taxonomies the project curates. Free-form tags belong in
  `metadata.tags` on the consuming entity, not in a Category
  entity.
- **Creating a Category for one-off use.** If the Category will be
  applied to a single entity and never reused, it's not a
  Category — it's just metadata on that entity.

### Fields

| Field         | Type           | Notes                                                  |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string         | Category name                                          |
| `description` | string         | What this axis categorizes                             |
| `axis`        | string         | The label key used on entities (e.g. `priority`)       |
| `values`      | list[object]   | `{name, description, optional metadata}`               |
| `applies_to`  | list[string]   | Primitive kinds this category applies to               |
| `default`     | string         | Optional. Default value if unspecified.                |
| `multi`       | bool           | Can an entity have multiple values? Default false.     |

### Hierarchical categories

A category value may have its own `children` for nested taxonomies:

```yaml
values:
  - name: backend
    children:
      - name: backend-api
      - name: backend-db
      - name: backend-queue
  - name: frontend
    children:
      - name: frontend-web
      - name: frontend-mobile
```

The validator accepts any leaf or any intermediate name.

### Retiring a value

Set `deprecated: true` on a value rather than removing it — existing entities
still reference it, and removing it would invalidate them.

### Categories vs Labels vs Roles

- **Category**: defined set of values for a classification axis.
- **Labels**: freeform key/value tags. No schema.
- **Roles**: named sets of responsibilities actors fill.

Categories are for closed sets. If the set is open and changes often, use
labels. If it's about who does things, it's a role.
