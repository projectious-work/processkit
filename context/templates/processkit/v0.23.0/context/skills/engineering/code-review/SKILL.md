# Code Review

## Intro

Code review is a structured pass over a diff against a fixed
checklist, then a categorized response: must-fix, should-fix, nit.
The goal is to surface real defects with specific line references,
not to rewrite the author's code.

## Overview

### The review checklist

Read the diff or changed files, then evaluate each change against:

- **Correctness** — Does the code do what it claims? Are edge
  cases handled?
- **Clarity** — Are names descriptive? Is the logic easy to
  follow on a single read?
- **Tests** — Are new behaviors tested? Do existing tests still
  hold?
- **Security** — Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, unsafe input
  handling, missing authz?
- **Performance** — Unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries,
  accidental O(n^2) loops?
- **Style** — Consistent with the project's existing conventions
  (not your personal preferences)?

### Categorize findings

Sort each finding into one bucket and label it explicitly:

- **Must fix** — bugs, security issues, broken tests, contract
  violations
- **Should fix** — unclear naming, missing tests for non-trivial
  paths, code smells
- **Nit** — style preferences, minor suggestions, taste calls

Always include specific line references and concrete suggestions.
Acknowledge what was done well — review is not adversarial.

## Gotchas

Agent-specific failure modes — provider-neutral pause-and-self-check items:

- **Burying must-fix items after style comments.** When a security issue or correctness bug appears three paragraphs into a review, the author may miss it. Lead with must-fix items; put nits at the end.
- **Vague comments without line references or concrete suggestions.** "This looks weird" is not actionable. Every finding needs a specific line reference and a concrete suggestion — what is the problem and what would fix it.
- **Stamp-of-approval review.** Skimming the diff and approving to move it along defeats the purpose of review and gives the team false confidence. If you cannot read the changed lines, say so and ask to review in a smaller chunk.
- **Reviewing huge diffs in one pass.** Large diffs cause reviewer fatigue and cause real issues to be missed. Either push back on PR scope or break the review into sessions (security first, then logic, then style).
- **Missing the escalation trigger.** Line-by-line comments on a diff that has fundamental design issues waste both sides' time. When the design is wrong, stop the line review and raise the design concern first.
- **Rewriting in review.** Proposing complete rewrites of code that works demotivates authors and overreaches the reviewer's role. Propose the improvement once; the author owns the code.
- **No acknowledgment of what was done well.** All-negative reviews are adversarial over time and reduce the quality of future work. Code review should also surface what was done right.

## Full reference

### Example output shape

> **Must fix:** `parse_input()` on line 42 doesn't handle empty
> strings — this will panic.
>
> **Should fix:** The variable `x` on line 15 could be renamed to
> `retry_count` for clarity.
>
> **Nit:** Consider extracting lines 30-45 into a helper function.
>
> Overall: Good separation of concerns. The error handling pattern
> is clean.

### Anti-patterns

- **Rewriting in review** — propose, don't dictate. The author
  owns the code.
- **Bikeshedding** — if it's a nit, label it a nit and move on.
- **Stamp-of-approval review** — skimming and approving without
  reading the changed lines defeats the purpose.
- **Vague comments** — "this looks weird" is not actionable. Say
  what's weird and what would fix it.
- **Reviewing in one pass when the diff is huge** — split the
  review across sessions or push back on PR scope.

### When to escalate

If the diff has fundamental design issues, stop the line-by-line
review and discuss the design first. Line comments on a diff that
should never have been written waste both sides' time.
