# Constraint Management

## Intro

A Constraint is an explicit rule or limit the project must respect: budget
ceilings, latency SLOs, team capacity, compliance requirements, dependency
restrictions. Capturing constraints as first-class entities makes them
referenceable from decisions and visible to trade-off analysis.

## Overview

### Shape

```yaml
---
apiVersion: processkit.projectious.work/v1
kind: Constraint
metadata:
  id: CONST-p99-latency
  created: 2026-04-06T00:00:00Z
spec:
  name: p99-latency
  description: "API p99 latency must stay under 200ms under normal load."
  kind: slo             # budget | slo | regulatory | capacity | dependency | policy | other
  severity: hard        # hard | soft | advisory
  measurement: "p99 of request duration over 5-minute windows"
  target: "< 200ms"
  source: "Customer SLA, signed 2026-01-15"
  active: true

```

### Workflow

1. Pick `CONST-<short-name>`.
2. Set `kind` — budget, SLO, regulatory, capacity, dependency, policy, or other.
3. Set `severity`: `hard` (cannot be violated), `soft` (flagged but overridable),
   `advisory` (informational).
4. Describe the `measurement` (how you know if it's met) and the `target`.
5. Record the `source` — where the constraint came from (contract, regulation,
   owner decision).

### Using constraints

- DecisionRecords link via `spec.related_constraints` when a decision was
  shaped by a constraint.
- WorkItems add `labels.constraint` when the work exists because of a constraint.
- Processes reference constraints via Bindings (`type: process-constraint`)
  for scoped constraints.

## Gotchas

Agent-specific failure modes — provider-neutral pause-and-self-check items:

- **Constraint without a measurable threshold.** "Performance must
  be good" is not a Constraint; "p99 latency must be under 200ms
  on the checkout endpoint" is. Without a threshold, you can't
  know whether the Constraint is satisfied.
- **Treating Constraints as suggestions.** Constraints are
  requirements. Decisions and WorkItems should explicitly reference
  the relevant CONSTRAINT-ID and confirm compliance, not hand-wave.
  If a Constraint is only sometimes true, it's a guideline, not a
  Constraint.
- **Forgetting the source / owner of the Constraint.** Where did
  this Constraint come from — legal, finance, oncall, the user's
  preference? The source matters because lifting it requires going
  back to the source. Always set `source` / `owner` fields.
- **Creating Constraints that contradict each other.** Two
  Constraints saying "ship as fast as possible" and "no production
  changes after 5pm" can both be valid, but the conflict must be
  noted explicitly so decisions can choose between them. Silent
  conflicts produce inconsistent behavior.
- **Hand-waving "complies with X" without referencing the
  CONSTRAINT-ID.** When a workitem or decision satisfies a
  Constraint, link the CONSTRAINT-ID explicitly. "We follow GDPR"
  with no link is unverifiable.
- **Confusing Constraints with Decisions.** A Constraint is a
  fixed rule the project respects ("budget ≤ $50k"); a Decision is
  a choice someone made ("we picked Postgres over MySQL"). If
  someone could change it tomorrow without external pressure, it's
  a Decision.
- **Constraints without expiry or review cadence.** Some
  Constraints are temporary ("hiring freeze through Q3"). Set a
  review date so the Constraint doesn't become permanent by
  default.

### Constraint violations

When a hard constraint is violated, write a `constraint.violated` LogEntry
rather than editing the Constraint file. Repeated violations may motivate a
DecisionRecord to relax the constraint or address the underlying cause.

### Retiring a constraint

Set `active: false` and log `constraint.retired`. Do not delete — historical
decisions may reference the constraint as part of their rationale.
